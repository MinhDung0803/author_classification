He lay at\\r\\nfull length upon his stomach, his feet resting upon the toes, his head\\r\\nupon the left forearm. His extended right hand loosely grasped his\\r\\nrifle. But for the somewhat methodical disposition of his limbs and a\\r\\nslight rhythmic movement of the cartridge-box at the back of his belt he\\r\\nmight have been thought to be dead. He was asleep at his post of duty.\\r\\nBut if detected he would be dead shortly afterward, death being the just\\r\\nand legal penalty of his crime.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe clump of laurel in which the criminal lay was in the angle of a road\\r\\nwhich after ascending southward a steep acclivity to that point turned\\r\\nsharply to the west, running along the summit for perhaps one hundred\\r\\nyards. There it turned southward again and went zigzagging downward\\r\\nthrough the forest. At the salient of that second angle was a large flat\\r\\nrock, jutting out northward, overlooking the deep valley from which the\\r\\nroad ascended. The rock capped a high cliff; a stone dropped from its\\r\\nouter edge would have fallen sheer downward one thousand feet to the\\r\\ntops of the pines. The angle where the soldier lay was on another spur\\r\\nof the same cliff. Had he been awake he would have commanded a view, not\\r\\nonly of the short arm of the road and the jutting rock, but of the\\r\\nentire profile of the cliff below it. It might well have made him giddy\\r\\nto look.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe country was wooded everywhere except at the bottom of the valley to\\r\\nthe northward, where there was a small natural meadow, through which\\r\\nflowed a stream scarcely visible from the valley\\'s rim. This open ground\\r\\nlooked hardly larger than an ordinary door-yard, but was really several\\r\\nacres in extent. Its green was more vivid than that of the inclosing\\r\\nforest. Away beyond it rose a line of giant cliffs similar to those upon\\r\\nwhich we are supposed to stand in our survey of the savage scene, and\\r\\nthrough which the road had somehow made its climb to the summit. The\\r\\nconfiguration of the valley, indeed, was such that from this point of\\r\\nobservation it seemed entirely shut in, and one could but have wondered\\r\\nhow the road which found a way out of it had found a way into it, and\\r\\nwhence came and whither went the waters of the stream that parted the\\r\\nmeadow more than a thousand feet below.\\r\\n\\r\\nNo country is so wild and difficult but men will make it a theatre of\\r\\nwar; concealed in the forest at the bottom of that military rat-trap, in\\r\\nwhich half a hundred men in possession of the exits might have starved\\r\\nan army to submission, lay five regiments of Federal infantry. They had\\r\\nmarched all the previous day and night and were resting. At nightfall\\r\\nthey would take to the road again, climb to the place where their\\r\\nunfaithful sentinel now slept, and descending the other slope of the\\r\\nridge fall upon a camp of the enemy at about midnight. Their hope was to\\r\\nsurprise it, for the road led to the rear of it. In case of failure,\\r\\ntheir position would be perilous in the extreme; and fail they surely\\r\\nwould should accident or vigilance apprise the enemy of the movement.\\r\\n\\r\\nII\\r\\n\\r\\nThe sleeping sentinel in the clump of laurel was a young Virginian named\\r\\nCarter Druse. He was the son of wealthy parents, an only child, and had\\r\\nknown such ease and cultivation and high living as wealth and taste were\\r\\nable to command in the mountain country of western Virginia. His home\\r\\nwas but a few miles from where he now lay. One morning he had risen from\\r\\nthe breakfast-table and said, quietly but gravely: \"Father, a Union\\r\\nregiment has arrived at Grafton. I am going to join it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe father lifted his leonine head, looked at the son a moment in\\r\\nsilence, and replied: \"Well, go, sir, and whatever may occur do what you\\r\\nconceive to be your duty. Virginia, to which you are a traitor, must get\\r\\non without you. Should we both live to the end of the war, we will speak\\r\\nfurther of the matter. Your mother, as the physician has informed you,\\r\\nis in a most critical condition; at the best she cannot be with us\\r\\nlonger than a few weeks, but that time is precious. It would be better\\r\\nnot to disturb her.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSo Carter Druse, bowing reverently to his father, who returned the\\r\\nsalute with a stately courtesy that masked a breaking heart, left the\\r\\nhome of his childhood to go soldiering. By conscience and courage, by\\r\\ndeeds of devotion and daring, he soon commended himself to his fellows\\r\\nand his officers; and it was to these qualities and to some knowledge of\\r\\nthe country that he owed his selection for his present perilous duty at\\r\\nthe extreme outpost. Nevertheless, fatigue had been stronger than\\r\\nresolution and he had fallen asleep. What good or bad angel came in a\\r\\ndream to rouse him from his state of crime, who shall say? Without a\\r\\nmovement, without a sound, in the profound silence and the languor of\\r\\nthe late afternoon, some invisible messenger of fate touched with\\r\\nunsealing finger the eyes of his consciousness--whispered into the ear\\r\\nof his spirit the mysterious awakening word which no human lips ever\\r\\nhave spoken, no human memory ever has recalled. He quietly raised his\\r\\nforehead from his arm and looked between the masking stems of the\\r\\nlaurels, instinctively closing his right hand about the stock of his\\r\\nrifle.\\r\\n\\r\\nHis first feeling was a keen artistic delight. On a colossal pedestal,\\r\\nthe cliff,--motionless at the extreme edge of the capping rock and\\r\\nsharply outlined against the sky,--was an equestrian statue of\\r\\nimpressive dignity. The figure of the man sat the figure of the horse,\\r\\nstraight and soldierly, but with the repose of a Grecian god carved in\\r\\nthe marble which limits the suggestion of activity. The gray costume\\r\\nharmonized with its a\\xc3\\xabrial background; the metal of accoutrement and\\r\\ncaparison was softened and subdued by the shadow; the animal\\'s skin had\\r\\nno points of high light. A carbine strikingly foreshortened lay across\\r\\nthe pommel of the saddle, kept in place by the right hand grasping it at\\r\\nthe \"grip\"; the left hand, holding the bridle rein, was invisible. In\\r\\nsilhouette against the sky the profile of the horse was cut with the\\r\\nsharpness of a cameo; it looked across the heights of air to the\\r\\nconfronting cliffs beyond. The face of the rider, turned slightly away,\\r\\nshowed only an outline of temple and beard; he was looking downward to\\r\\nthe bottom of the valley. Magnified by its lift against the sky and by\\r\\nthe soldier\\'s testifying sense of the formidableness of a near enemy the\\r\\ngroup appeared of heroic, almost colossal, size.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor an instant Druse had a strange, half-defined feeling that he had\\r\\nslept to the end of the war and was looking upon a noble work of art\\r\\nreared upon that eminence to commemorate the deeds of an heroic past of\\r\\nwhich he had been an inglorious part. The feeling was dispelled by a\\r\\nslight movement of the group: the horse, without moving its feet, had\\r\\ndrawn its body slightly backward from the verge; the man remained\\r\\nimmobile as before. Broad awake and keenly alive to the significance of\\r\\nthe situation, Druse now brought the butt of his rifle against his cheek\\r\\nby cautiously pushing the barrel forward through the bushes, cocked the\\r\\npiece, and glancing through the sights covered a vital spot of the\\r\\nhorseman\\'s breast. A touch upon the trigger and all would have been well\\r\\nwith Carter Druse. At that instant the horseman turned his head and\\r\\nlooked in the direction of his concealed foeman--seemed to look into his\\r\\nvery face, into his eyes, into his brave, compassionate heart.\\r\\n\\r\\nIs it then so terrible to kill an enemy in war--an enemy who has\\r\\nsurprised a secret vital to the safety of one\\'s self and comrades--an\\r\\nenemy more formidable for his knowledge than all his army for its\\r\\nnumbers? Carter Druse grew pale; he shook in every limb, turned faint,\\r\\nand saw the statuesque group before him as black figures, rising,\\r\\nfalling, moving unsteadily in arcs of circles in a fiery sky. His hand\\r\\nfell away from his weapon, his head slowly dropped until his face rested\\r\\non the leaves in which he lay. This courageous gentleman and hardy\\r\\nsoldier was near swooning from intensity of emotion.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was not for long; in another moment his face was raised from earth,\\r\\nhis hands resumed their places on the rifle, his forefinger sought the\\r\\ntrigger; mind, heart, and eyes were clear, conscience and reason sound.\\r\\nHe could not hope to capture that enemy; to alarm him would but send him\\r\\ndashing to his camp with his fatal news. The duty of the soldier was\\r\\nplain: the man must be shot dead from ambush--without warning, without a\\r\\nmoment\\'s spiritual preparation, with never so much as an unspoken\\r\\nprayer, he must be sent to his account. But no--there is a hope; he may\\r\\nhave discovered nothing--perhaps he is but admiring the sublimity of the\\r\\nlandscape. If permitted, he may turn and ride carelessly away in the\\r\\ndirection whence he came. Surely it will be possible to judge at the\\r\\ninstant of his withdrawing whether he knows. It may well be that his\\r\\nfixity of attention--Druse turned his head and looked through the deeps\\r\\nof air downward, as from the surface to the bottom of a translucent sea.\\r\\nHe saw creeping across the green meadow a sinuous line of figures of men\\r\\nand horses--some foolish commander was permitting the soldiers of his\\r\\nescort to water their beasts in the open, in plain view from a dozen\\r\\nsummits!\\r\\n\\r\\nDruse withdrew his eyes from the valley and fixed them again upon the\\r\\ngroup of man and horse in the sky, and again it was through the sights\\r\\nof his rifle. But this time his aim was at the horse. In his memory, as\\r\\nif they were a divine mandate, rang the words of his father at their\\r\\nparting: \"Whatever may occur, do what you conceive to be your duty.\" He\\r\\nwas calm now. His teeth were firmly but not rigidly closed; his nerves\\r\\nwere as tranquil as a sleeping babe\\'s--not a tremor affected any muscle\\r\\nof his body; his breathing, until suspended in the act of taking aim,\\r\\nwas regular and slow. Duty had conquered; the spirit had said to the\\r\\nbody: \"Peace, be still.\" He fired.\\r\\n\\r\\nIII\\r\\n\\r\\nAn officer of the Federal force, who in a spirit of adventure or in\\r\\nquest of knowledge had left the hidden _bivouac_ in the valley, and with\\r\\naimless feet had made his way to the lower edge of a small open space\\r\\nnear the foot of the cliff, was considering what he had to gain by\\r\\npushing his exploration further. At a distance of a quarter-mile before\\r\\nhim, but apparently at a stone\\'s throw, rose from its fringe of pines\\r\\nthe gigantic face of rock, towering to so great a height above him that\\r\\nit made him giddy to look up to where its edge cut a sharp, rugged line\\r\\nagainst the sky. It presented a clean, vertical profile against a\\r\\nbackground of blue sky to a point half the way down, and of distant\\r\\nhills, hardly less blue, thence to the tops of the trees at its base.\\r\\nLifting his eyes to the dizzy altitude of its summit the officer saw an\\r\\nastonishing sight--a man on horseback riding down into the valley\\r\\nthrough the air!\\r\\n\\r\\nStraight upright sat the rider, in military fashion, with a firm seat in\\r\\nthe saddle, a strong clutch upon the rein to hold his charger from too\\r\\nimpetuous a plunge. From his bare head his long hair streamed upward,\\r\\nwaving like a plume. His hands were concealed in the cloud of the\\r\\nhorse\\'s lifted mane. The animal\\'s body was as level as if every\\r\\nhoof-stroke encountered the resistant earth. Its motions were those of a\\r\\nwild gallop, but even as the officer looked they ceased, with all the\\r\\nlegs thrown sharply forward as in the act of alighting from a leap. But\\r\\nthis was a flight!\\r\\n\\r\\nFilled with amazement and terror by this apparition of a horseman in the\\r\\nsky--half believing himself the chosen scribe of some new Apocalypse,\\r\\nthe officer was overcome by the intensity of his emotions; his legs\\r\\nfailed him and he fell. Almost at the same instant he heard a crashing\\r\\nsound in the trees--a sound that died without an echo--and all was\\r\\nstill.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe officer rose to his feet, trembling. The familiar sensation of an\\r\\nabraded shin recalled his dazed faculties. Pulling himself together he\\r\\nran rapidly obliquely away from the cliff to a point distant from its\\r\\nfoot; thereabout he expected to find his man; and thereabout he\\r\\nnaturally failed. In the fleeting instant of his vision his imagination\\r\\nhad been so wrought upon by the apparent grace and ease and intention of\\r\\nthe marvelous performance that it did not occur to him that the line of\\r\\nmarch of a\\xc3\\xabrial cavalry is directly downward, and that he could find the\\r\\nobjects of his search at the very foot of the cliff. A half-hour later\\r\\nhe returned to camp.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis officer was a wise man; he knew better than to tell an incredible\\r\\ntruth. He said nothing of what he had seen. But when the commander asked\\r\\nhim if in his scout he had learned anything of advantage to the\\r\\nexpedition he answered:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, sir; there is no road leading down into this valley from the\\r\\nsouthward.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe commander, knowing better, smiled.\\r\\n\\r\\nIV\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter firing his shot, Private Carter Druse reloaded his rifle and\\r\\nresumed his watch. Ten minutes had hardly passed when a Federal sergeant\\r\\ncrept cautiously to him on hands and knees. Druse neither turned his\\r\\nhead nor looked at him, but lay without motion or sign of recognition.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Did you fire?\" the sergeant whispered.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"At what?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"A horse. It was standing on yonder rock--pretty far out. You see it is\\r\\nno longer there. It went over the cliff.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe man\\'s face was white, but he showed no other sign of emotion. Having\\r\\nanswered, he turned away his eyes and said no more. The sergeant did not\\r\\nunderstand.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"See here, Druse,\" he said, after a moment\\'s silence, \"it\\'s no use\\r\\nmaking a mystery. I order you to report. Was there anybody on the\\r\\nhorse?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My father.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe sergeant rose to his feet and walked away. \"Good God!\" he said.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAN OCCURRENCE AT OWL CREEK BRIDGE\\r\\n\\r\\nI\\r\\n\\r\\nA man stood upon a railroad bridge in northern Alabama, looking down\\r\\ninto the swift water twenty feet below. The man\\'s hands were behind his\\r\\nback, the wrists bound with a cord. A rope closely encircled his neck.\\r\\nIt was attached to a stout cross-timber above his head and the slack\\r\\nfell to the level of his knees. Some loose boards laid upon the sleepers\\r\\nsupporting the metals of the railway supplied a footing for him and his\\r\\nexecutioners--two private soldiers of the Federal army, directed by a\\r\\nsergeant who in civil life may have been a deputy sheriff. At a short\\r\\nremove upon the same temporary platform was an officer in the uniform of\\r\\nhis rank, armed. He was a captain. A sentinel at each end of the bridge\\r\\nstood with his rifle in the position known as \"support,\" that is to say,\\r\\nvertical in front of the left shoulder, the hammer resting on the\\r\\nforearm thrown straight across the chest--a formal and unnatural\\r\\nposition, enforcing an erect carriage of the body. It did not appear to\\r\\nbe the duty of these two men to know what was occurring at the centre of\\r\\nthe bridge; they merely blockaded the two ends of the foot planking that\\r\\ntraversed it.\\r\\n\\r\\nBeyond one of the sentinels nobody was in sight; the railroad ran\\r\\nstraight away into a forest for a hundred yards, then, curving, was lost\\r\\nto view. Doubtless there was an outpost farther along. The other bank of\\r\\nthe stream was open ground--a gentle acclivity topped with a stockade of\\r\\nvertical tree trunks, loop-holed for rifles, with a single embrasure\\r\\nthrough which protruded the muzzle of a brass cannon commanding the\\r\\nbridge. Mid-way of the slope between bridge and fort were the\\r\\nspectators--a single company of infantry in line, at \"parade rest,\" the\\r\\nbutts of the rifles on the ground, the barrels inclining slightly\\r\\nbackward against the right shoulder, the hands crossed upon the stock. A\\r\\nlieutenant stood at the right of the line, the point of his sword upon\\r\\nthe ground, his left hand resting upon his right. Excepting the group of\\r\\nfour at the centre of the bridge, not a man moved. The company faced the\\r\\nbridge, staring stonily, motionless. The sentinels, facing the banks of\\r\\nthe stream, might have been statues to adorn the bridge. The captain\\r\\nstood with folded arms, silent, observing the work of his subordinates,\\r\\nbut making no sign. Death is a dignitary who when he comes announced is\\r\\nto be received with formal manifestations of respect, even by those most\\r\\nfamiliar with him. In the code of military etiquette silence and fixity\\r\\nare forms of deference.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe man who was engaged in being hanged was apparently about thirty-five\\r\\nyears of age. He was a civilian, if one might judge from his habit,\\r\\nwhich was that of a planter. His features were good--a straight nose,\\r\\nfirm mouth, broad forehead, from which his long, dark hair was combed\\r\\nstraight back, falling behind his ears to the collar of his well-fitting\\r\\nfrock-coat. He wore a mustache and pointed beard, but no whiskers; his\\r\\neyes were large and dark gray, and had a kindly expression which one\\r\\nwould hardly have expected in one whose neck was in the hemp. Evidently\\r\\nthis was no vulgar assassin. The liberal military code makes provision\\r\\nfor hanging many kinds of persons, and gentlemen are not excluded.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe preparations being complete, the two private soldiers stepped aside\\r\\nand each drew away the plank upon which he had been standing. The\\r\\nsergeant turned to the captain, saluted and placed himself immediately\\r\\nbehind that officer, who in turn moved apart one pace. These movements\\r\\nleft the condemned man and the sergeant standing on the two ends of the\\r\\nsame plank, which spanned three of the cross-ties of the bridge. The end\\r\\nupon which the civilian stood almost, but not quite, reached a fourth.\\r\\nThis plank had been held in place by the weight of the captain; it was\\r\\nnow held by that of the sergeant. At a signal from the former the latter\\r\\nwould step aside, the plank would tilt and the condemned man go down\\r\\nbetween two ties. The arrangement commended itself to his judgment as\\r\\nsimple and effective. His face had not been covered nor his eyes\\r\\nbandaged. He looked a moment at his \"unsteadfast footing,\" then let his\\r\\ngaze wander to the swirling water of the stream racing madly beneath his\\r\\nfeet. A piece of dancing driftwood caught his attention and his eyes\\r\\nfollowed it down the current. How slowly it appeared to move! What a\\r\\nsluggish stream!\\r\\n\\r\\nHe closed his eyes in order to fix his last thoughts upon his wife and\\r\\nchildren. The water, touched to gold by the early sun, the brooding\\r\\nmists under the banks at some distance down the stream, the fort, the\\r\\nsoldiers, the piece of drift--all had distracted him. And now he became\\r\\nconscious of a new disturbance. Striking through the thought of his dear\\r\\nones was a sound which he could neither ignore nor understand, a sharp,\\r\\ndistinct, metallic percussion like the stroke of a blacksmith\\'s hammer\\r\\nupon the anvil; it had the same ringing quality. He wondered what it\\r\\nwas, and whether immeasurably distant or near by--it seemed both. Its\\r\\nrecurrence was regular, but as slow as the tolling of a death knell. He\\r\\nawaited each stroke with impatience and--he knew not why--apprehension.\\r\\nThe intervals of silence grew progressively longer; the delays became\\r\\nmaddening. With their greater infrequency the sounds increased in\\r\\nstrength and sharpness. They hurt his ear like the thrust of a knife; he\\r\\nfeared he would shriek. What he heard was the ticking of his watch.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe unclosed his eyes and saw again the water below him. \"If I could free\\r\\nmy hands,\" he thought, \"I might throw off the noose and spring into the\\r\\nstream. By diving I could evade the bullets and, swimming vigorously,\\r\\nreach the bank, take to the woods and get away home. My home, thank God,\\r\\nis as yet outside their lines; my wife and little ones are still beyond\\r\\nthe invader\\'s farthest advance.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAs these thoughts, which have here to be set down in words, were flashed\\r\\ninto the doomed man\\'s brain rather than evolved from it the captain\\r\\nnodded to the sergeant. The sergeant stepped aside.\\r\\n\\r\\nII\\r\\n\\r\\nPeyton Farquhar was a well-to-do planter, of an old and highly respected\\r\\nAlabama family. Being a slave owner and like other slave owners a\\r\\npolitician he was naturally an original secessionist and ardently\\r\\ndevoted to the Southern cause. Circumstances of an imperious nature,\\r\\nwhich it is unnecessary to relate here, had prevented him from taking\\r\\nservice with the gallant army that had fought the disastrous campaigns\\r\\nending with the fall of Corinth, and he chafed under the inglorious\\r\\nrestraint, longing for the release of his energies, the larger life of\\r\\nthe soldier, the opportunity for distinction. That opportunity, he felt,\\r\\nwould come, as it comes to all in war time. Meanwhile he did what he\\r\\ncould. No service was too humble for him to perform in aid of the South,\\r\\nno adventure too perilous for him to undertake if consistent with the\\r\\ncharacter of a civilian who was at heart a soldier, and who in good\\r\\nfaith and without too much qualification assented to at least a part of\\r\\nthe frankly villainous dictum that all is fair in love and war.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne evening while Farquhar and his wife were sitting on a rustic bench\\r\\nnear the entrance to his grounds, a gray-clad soldier rode up to the\\r\\ngate and asked for a drink of water. Mrs. Farquhar was only too happy to\\r\\nserve him with her own white hands. While she was fetching the water her\\r\\nhusband approached the dusty horseman and inquired eagerly for news from\\r\\nthe front.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The Yanks are repairing the railroads,\" said the man, \"and are getting\\r\\nready for another advance. They have reached the Owl Creek bridge, put\\r\\nit in order and built a stockade on the north bank. The commandant has\\r\\nissued an order, which is posted everywhere, declaring that any civilian\\r\\ncaught interfering with the railroad, its bridges, tunnels or trains\\r\\nwill be summarily hanged. I saw the order.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How far is it to the Owl Creek bridge?\" Farquhar asked.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"About thirty miles.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Is there no force on this side the creek?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Only a picket post half a mile out, on the railroad, and a single\\r\\nsentinel at this end of the bridge.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Suppose a man--a civilian and student of hanging--should elude the\\r\\npicket post and perhaps get the better of the sentinel,\" said Farquhar,\\r\\nsmiling, \"what could he accomplish?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe soldier reflected. \"I was there a month ago,\" he replied. \"I\\r\\nobserved that the flood of last winter had lodged a great quantity of\\r\\ndriftwood against the wooden pier at this end of the bridge. It is now\\r\\ndry and would burn like tow.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe lady had now brought the water, which the soldier drank. He thanked\\r\\nher ceremoniously, bowed to her husband and rode away. An hour later,\\r\\nafter nightfall, he repassed the plantation, going northward in the\\r\\ndirection from which he had come. He was a Federal scout.\\r\\n\\r\\nIII\\r\\n\\r\\nAs Peyton Farquhar fell straight downward through the bridge he lost\\r\\nconsciousness and was as one already dead. From this state he was\\r\\nawakened--ages later, it seemed to him--by the pain of a sharp pressure\\r\\nupon his throat, followed by a sense of suffocation. Keen, poignant\\r\\nagonies seemed to shoot from his neck downward through every fibre of\\r\\nhis body and limbs. These pains appeared to flash along well-defined\\r\\nlines of ramification and to beat with an inconceivably rapid\\r\\nperiodicity. They seemed like streams of pulsating fire heating him to\\r\\nan intolerable temperature. As to his head, he was conscious of nothing\\r\\nbut a feeling of fulness--of congestion. These sensations were\\r\\nunaccompanied by thought. The intellectual part of his nature was\\r\\nalready effaced; he had power only to feel, and feeling was torment. He\\r\\nwas conscious of motion. Encompassed in a luminous cloud, of which he\\r\\nwas now merely the fiery heart, without material substance, he swung\\r\\nthrough unthinkable arcs of oscillation, like a vast pendulum. Then all\\r\\nat once, with terrible suddenness, the light about him shot upward with\\r\\nthe noise of a loud plash; a frightful roaring was in his ears, and all\\r\\nwas cold and dark. The power of thought was restored; he knew that the\\r\\nrope had broken and he had fallen into the stream. There was no\\r\\nadditional strangulation; the noose about his neck was already\\r\\nsuffocating him and kept the water from his lungs. To die of hanging at\\r\\nthe bottom of a river!--the idea seemed to him ludicrous. He opened his\\r\\neyes in the darkness and saw above him a gleam of light, but how\\r\\ndistant, how inaccessible! He was still sinking, for the light became\\r\\nfainter and fainter until it was a mere glimmer. Then it began to grow\\r\\nand brighten, and he knew that he was rising toward the surface--knew it\\r\\nwith reluctance, for he was now very comfortable. \"To be hanged and\\r\\ndrowned,\" he thought, \"that is not so bad; but I do not wish to be shot.\\r\\nNo; I will not be shot; that is not fair.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was not conscious of an effort, but a sharp pain in his wrist\\r\\napprised him that he was trying to free his hands. He gave the struggle\\r\\nhis attention, as an idler might observe the feat of a juggler, without\\r\\ninterest in the outcome. What splendid effort!--what magnificent, what\\r\\nsuperhuman strength! Ah, that was a fine endeavor! Bravo! The cord fell\\r\\naway; his arms parted and floated upward, the hands dimly seen on each\\r\\nside in the growing light. He watched them with a new interest as first\\r\\none and then the other pounced upon the noose at his neck. They tore it\\r\\naway and thrust it fiercely aside, its undulations resembling those of a\\r\\nwater-snake. \"Put it back, put it back!\" He thought he shouted these\\r\\nwords to his hands, for the undoing of the noose had been succeeded by\\r\\nthe direst pang that he had yet experienced. His neck ached horribly;\\r\\nhis brain was on fire; his heart, which had been fluttering faintly,\\r\\ngave a great leap, trying to force itself out at his mouth. His whole\\r\\nbody was racked and wrenched with an insupportable anguish! But his\\r\\ndisobedient hands gave no heed to the command. They beat the water\\r\\nvigorously with quick, downward strokes, forcing him to the surface. He\\r\\nfelt his head emerge; his eyes were blinded by the sunlight; his chest\\r\\nexpanded convulsively, and with a supreme and crowning agony his lungs\\r\\nengulfed a great draught of air, which instantly he expelled in a\\r\\nshriek!\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was now in full possession of his physical senses. They were, indeed,\\r\\npreternaturally keen and alert. Something in the awful disturbance of\\r\\nhis organic system had so exalted and refined them that they made record\\r\\nof things never before perceived. He felt the ripples upon his face and\\r\\nheard their separate sounds as they struck. He looked at the forest on\\r\\nthe bank of the stream, saw the individual trees, the leaves and the\\r\\nveining of each leaf--saw the very insects upon them: the locusts, the\\r\\nbrilliant-bodied flies, the gray spiders stretching their webs from twig\\r\\nto twig. He noted the prismatic colors in all the dewdrops upon a\\r\\nmillion blades of grass. The humming of the gnats that danced above the\\r\\neddies of the stream, the beating of the dragon-flies\\' wings, the\\r\\nstrokes of the water-spiders\\' legs, like oars which had lifted their\\r\\nboat--all these made audible music. A fish slid along beneath his eyes\\r\\nand he heard the rush of its body parting the water.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe had come to the surface facing down the stream; in a moment the\\r\\nvisible world seemed to wheel slowly round, himself the pivotal point,\\r\\nand he saw the bridge, the fort, the soldiers upon the bridge, the\\r\\ncaptain, the sergeant, the two privates, his executioners. They were in\\r\\nsilhouette against the blue sky. They shouted and gesticulated, pointing\\r\\nat him. The captain had drawn his pistol, but did not fire; the others\\r\\nwere unarmed. Their movements were grotesque and horrible, their forms\\r\\ngigantic.\\r\\n\\r\\nSuddenly he heard a sharp report and something struck the water smartly\\r\\nwithin a few inches of his head, spattering his face with spray. He\\r\\nheard a second report, and saw one of the sentinels with his rifle at\\r\\nhis shoulder, a light cloud of blue smoke rising from the muzzle. The\\r\\nman in the water saw the eye of the man on the bridge gazing into his\\r\\nown through the sights of the rifle. He observed that it was a gray eye\\r\\nand remembered having read that gray eyes were keenest, and that all\\r\\nfamous markmen had them. Nevertheless, this one had missed.\\r\\n\\r\\nA counter-swirl had caught Farquhar and turned him half round; he was\\r\\nagain looking into the forest on the bank opposite the fort. The sound\\r\\nof a clear, high voice in a monotonous singsong now rang out behind him\\r\\nand came across the water with a distinctness that pierced and subdued\\r\\nall other sounds, even the beating of the ripples in his ears. Although\\r\\nno soldier, he had frequented camps enough to know the dread\\r\\nsignificance of that deliberate, drawling, aspirated chant; the\\r\\nlieutenant on shore was taking a part in the morning\\'s work. How coldly\\r\\nand pitilessly--with what an even, calm intonation, presaging, and\\r\\nenforcing tranquillity in the men--with what accurately measured\\r\\nintervals fell those cruel words:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Attention, company!... Shoulder arms!... Ready!... Aim!... Fire!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nFarquhar dived--dived as deeply as he could. The water roared in his\\r\\nears like the voice of Niagara, yet he heard the dulled thunder of the\\r\\nvolley and, rising again toward the surface, met shining bits of metal,\\r\\nsingularly flattened, oscillating slowly downward. Some of them touched\\r\\nhim on the face and hands, then fell away, continuing their descent. One\\r\\nlodged between his collar and neck; it was uncomfortably warm and he\\r\\nsnatched it out.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs he rose to the surface, gasping for breath, he saw that he had been a\\r\\nlong time under water; he was perceptibly farther down stream--nearer to\\r\\nsafety. The soldiers had almost finished reloading; the metal ramrods\\r\\nflashed all at once in the sunshine as they were drawn from the barrels,\\r\\nturned in the air, and thrust into their sockets. The two sentinels\\r\\nfired again, independently and ineffectually.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe hunted man saw all this over his shoulder; he was now swimming\\r\\nvigorously with the current. His brain was as energetic as his arms and\\r\\nlegs; he thought with the rapidity of lightning.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The officer,\" he reasoned, \"will not make that martinet\\'s error a\\r\\nsecond time. It is as easy to dodge a volley as a single shot. He has\\r\\nprobably already given the command to fire at will. God help me, I\\r\\ncannot dodge them all!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAn appalling plash within two yards of him was followed by a loud,\\r\\nrushing sound, _diminuendo_, which seemed to travel back through the air\\r\\nto the fort and died in an explosion which stirred the very river to its\\r\\ndeeps! A rising sheet of water curved over him, fell down upon him,\\r\\nblinded him, strangled him! The cannon had taken a hand in the game. As\\r\\nhe shook his head free from the commotion of the smitten water he heard\\r\\nthe deflected shot humming through the air ahead, and in an instant it\\r\\nwas cracking and smashing the branches in the forest beyond.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"They will not do that again,\" he thought; \"the next time they will use\\r\\na charge of grape. I must keep my eye upon the gun; the smoke will\\r\\napprise me--the report arrives too late; it lags behind the missile.\\r\\nThat is a good gun.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSuddenly he felt himself whirled round and round--spinning like a top.\\r\\nThe water, the banks, the forests, the now distant bridge, fort and men\\r\\n--all were commingled and blurred. Objects were represented by their\\r\\ncolors only; circular horizontal streaks of color--that was all he saw.\\r\\nHe had been caught in a vortex and was being whirled on with a velocity\\r\\nof advance and gyration that made him giddy and sick. In a few moments\\r\\nhe was flung upon the gravel at the foot of the left bank of the stream\\r\\n--the southern bank--and behind a projecting point which concealed him\\r\\nfrom his enemies. The sudden arrest of his motion, the abrasion of one\\r\\nof his hands on the gravel, restored him, and he wept with delight. He\\r\\ndug his fingers into the sand, threw it over himself in handfuls and\\r\\naudibly blessed it. It looked like diamonds, rubies, emeralds; he could\\r\\nthink of nothing beautiful which it did not resemble. The trees upon the\\r\\nbank were giant garden plants; he noted a definite order in their\\r\\narrangement, inhaled the fragrance of their blooms. A strange, roseate\\r\\nlight shone through the spaces among their trunks and the wind made in\\r\\ntheir branches the music of \\xc3\\xa6olian harps. He had no wish to perfect his\\r\\nescape--was content to remain in that enchanting spot until retaken.\\r\\n\\r\\nA whiz and rattle of grapeshot among the branches high above his head\\r\\nroused him from his dream. The baffled cannoneer had fired him a random\\r\\nfarewell. He sprang to his feet, rushed up the sloping bank, and plunged\\r\\ninto the forest.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll that day he traveled, laying his course by the rounding sun. The\\r\\nforest seemed interminable; nowhere did he discover a break in it, not\\r\\neven a woodman\\'s road. He had not known that he lived in so wild a\\r\\nregion. There was something uncanny in the revelation.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy nightfall he was fatigued, footsore, famishing. The thought of his\\r\\nwife and children urged him on. At last he found a road which led him in\\r\\nwhat he knew to be the right direction. It was as wide and straight as a\\r\\ncity street, yet it seemed untraveled. No fields bordered it, no\\r\\ndwelling anywhere. Not so much as the barking of a dog suggested human\\r\\nhabitation. The black bodies of the trees formed a straight wall on both\\r\\nsides, terminating on the horizon in a point, like a diagram in a lesson\\r\\nin perspective. Over-head, as he looked up through this rift in the\\r\\nwood, shone great golden stars looking unfamiliar and grouped in strange\\r\\nconstellations. He was sure they were arranged in some order which had a\\r\\nsecret and malign significance. The wood on either side was full of\\r\\nsingular noises, among which--once, twice, and again--he distinctly\\r\\nheard whispers in an unknown tongue.\\r\\n\\r\\nHis neck was in pain and lifting his hand to it he found it horribly\\r\\nswollen. He knew that it had a circle of black where the rope had\\r\\nbruised it. His eyes felt congested; he could no longer close them. His\\r\\ntongue was swollen with thirst; he relieved its fever by thrusting it\\r\\nforward from between his teeth into the cold air. How softly the turf\\r\\nhad carpeted the untraveled avenue--he could no longer feel the roadway\\r\\nbeneath his feet!\\r\\n\\r\\nDoubtless, despite his suffering, he had fallen asleep while walking,\\r\\nfor now he sees another scene--perhaps he has merely recovered from a\\r\\ndelirium. He stands at the gate of his own home. All is as he left it,\\r\\nand all bright and beautiful in the morning sunshine. He must have\\r\\ntraveled the entire night. As he pushes open the gate and passes up the\\r\\nwide white walk, he sees a flutter of female garments; his wife, looking\\r\\nfresh and cool and sweet, steps down from the veranda to meet him. At\\r\\nthe bottom of the steps she stands waiting, with a smile of ineffable\\r\\njoy, an attitude of matchless grace and dignity. Ah, how beautiful she\\r\\nis! He springs forward with extended arms. As he is about to clasp her\\r\\nhe feels a stunning blow upon the back of the neck; a blinding white\\r\\nlight blazes all about him with a sound like the shock of a cannon--then\\r\\nall is darkness and silence!\\r\\n\\r\\nPeyton Farquhar was dead; his body, with a broken neck, swung gently\\r\\nfrom side to side beneath the timbers of the Owl Creek bridge.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHICKAMAUGA\\r\\n\\r\\nOne sunny autumn afternoon a child strayed away from its rude home in a\\r\\nsmall field and entered a forest unobserved. It was happy in a new sense\\r\\nof freedom from control, happy in the opportunity of exploration and\\r\\nadventure; for this child\\'s spirit, in bodies of its ancestors, had for\\r\\nthousands of years been trained to memorable feats of discovery and\\r\\nconquest--victories in battles whose critical moments were centuries,\\r\\nwhose victors\\' camps were cities of hewn stone. From the cradle of its\\r\\nrace it had conquered its way through two continents and passing a great\\r\\nsea had penetrated a third, there to be born to war and dominion as a\\r\\nheritage.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe child was a boy aged about six years, the son of a poor planter. In\\r\\nhis younger manhood the father had been a soldier, had fought against\\r\\nnaked savages and followed the flag of his country into the capital of a\\r\\ncivilized race to the far South. In the peaceful life of a planter the\\r\\nwarrior-fire survived; once kindled, it is never extinguished. The man\\r\\nloved military books and pictures and the boy had understood enough to\\r\\nmake himself a wooden sword, though even the eye of his father would\\r\\nhardly have known it for what it was. This weapon he now bore bravely,\\r\\nas became the son of an heroic race, and pausing now and again in the\\r\\nsunny space of the forest assumed, with some exaggeration, the postures\\r\\nof aggression and defense that he had been taught by the engraver\\'s art.\\r\\nMade reckless by the ease with which he overcame invisible foes\\r\\nattempting to stay his advance, he committed the common enough military\\r\\nerror of pushing the pursuit to a dangerous extreme, until he found\\r\\nhimself upon the margin of a wide but shallow brook, whose rapid waters\\r\\nbarred his direct advance against the flying foe that had crossed with\\r\\nillogical ease. But the intrepid victor was not to be baffled; the\\r\\nspirit of the race which had passed the great sea burned unconquerable\\r\\nin that small breast and would not be denied. Finding a place where some\\r\\nbowlders in the bed of the stream lay but a step or a leap apart, he\\r\\nmade his way across and fell again upon the rear-guard of his imaginary\\r\\nfoe, putting all to the sword.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow that the battle had been won, prudence required that he withdraw to\\r\\nhis base of operations. Alas; like many a mightier conqueror, and like\\r\\none, the mightiest, he could not\\r\\n\\r\\n                           curb the lust for war,\\r\\n  Nor learn that tempted Fate will leave the loftiest star.\\r\\n\\r\\nAdvancing from the bank of the creek he suddenly found himself\\r\\nconfronted with a new and more formidable enemy: in the path that he was\\r\\nfollowing, sat, bolt upright, with ears erect and paws suspended before\\r\\nit, a rabbit! With a startled cry the child turned and fled, he knew not\\r\\nin what direction, calling with inarticulate cries for his mother,\\r\\nweeping, stumbling, his tender skin cruelly torn by brambles, his little\\r\\nheart beating hard with terror--breathless, blind with tears--lost in\\r\\nthe forest! Then, for more than an hour, he wandered with erring feet\\r\\nthrough the tangled undergrowth, till at last, overcome by fatigue, he\\r\\nlay down in a narrow space between two rocks, within a few yards of the\\r\\nstream and still grasping his toy sword, no longer a weapon but a\\r\\ncompanion, sobbed himself to sleep. The wood birds sang merrily above\\r\\nhis head; the squirrels, whisking their bravery of tail, ran barking\\r\\nfrom tree to tree, unconscious of the pity of it, and somewhere far away\\r\\nwas a strange, muffled thunder, as if the partridges were drumming in\\r\\ncelebration of nature\\'s victory over the son of her immemorial\\r\\nenslavers. And back at the little plantation, where white men and black\\r\\nwere hastily searching the fields and hedges in alarm, a mother\\'s heart\\r\\nwas breaking for her missing child.\\r\\n\\r\\nHours passed, and then the little sleeper rose to his feet. The chill of\\r\\nthe evening was in his limbs, the fear of the gloom in his heart. But he\\r\\nhad rested, and he no longer wept. With some blind instinct which\\r\\nimpelled to action he struggled through the undergrowth about him and\\r\\ncame to a more open ground--on his right the brook, to the left a\\r\\ngentle acclivity studded with infrequent trees; over all, the gathering\\r\\ngloom of twilight. A thin, ghostly mist rose along the water. It\\r\\nfrightened and repelled him; instead of recrossing, in the direction\\r\\nwhence he had come, he turned his back upon it, and went forward toward\\r\\nthe dark inclosing wood. Suddenly he saw before him a strange moving\\r\\nobject which he took to be some large animal--a dog, a pig--he could not\\r\\nname it; perhaps it was a bear. He had seen pictures of bears, but knew\\r\\nof nothing to their discredit and had vaguely wished to meet one. But\\r\\nsomething in form or movement of this object--something in the\\r\\nawkwardness of its approach--told him that it was not a bear, and\\r\\ncuriosity was stayed by fear. He stood still and as it came slowly on\\r\\ngained courage every moment, for he saw that at least it had not the\\r\\nlong, menacing ears of the rabbit. Possibly his impressionable mind was\\r\\nhalf conscious of something familiar in its shambling, awkward gait.\\r\\nBefore it had approached near enough to resolve his doubts he saw that\\r\\nit was followed by another and another. To right and to left were many\\r\\nmore; the whole open space about him was alive with them--all moving\\r\\ntoward the brook.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey were men. They crept upon their hands and knees. They used their\\r\\nhands only, dragging their legs. They used their knees only, their arms\\r\\nhanging idle at their sides. They strove to rise to their feet, but fell\\r\\nprone in the attempt. They did nothing naturally, and nothing alike,\\r\\nsave only to advance foot by foot in the same direction. Singly, in\\r\\npairs and in little groups, they came on through the gloom, some halting\\r\\nnow and again while others crept slowly past them, then resuming their\\r\\nmovement. They came by dozens and by hundreds; as far on either hand as\\r\\none could see in the deepening gloom they extended and the black wood\\r\\nbehind them appeared to be inexhaustible. The very ground seemed in\\r\\nmotion toward the creek. Occasionally one who had paused did not again\\r\\ngo on, but lay motionless. He was dead. Some, pausing, made strange\\r\\ngestures with their hands, erected their arms and lowered them again,\\r\\nclasped their heads; spread their palms upward, as men are sometimes\\r\\nseen to do in public prayer.\\r\\n\\r\\nNot all of this did the child note; it is what would have been noted by\\r\\nan elder observer; he saw little but that these were men, yet crept like\\r\\nbabes. Being men, they were not terrible, though unfamiliarly clad. He\\r\\nmoved among them freely, going from one to another and peering into\\r\\ntheir faces with childish curiosity. All their faces were singularly\\r\\nwhite and many were streaked and gouted with red. Something in this--\\r\\nsomething too, perhaps, in their grotesque attitudes and movements--\\r\\nreminded him of the painted clown whom he had seen last summer in the\\r\\ncircus, and he laughed as he watched them. But on and ever on they\\r\\ncrept, these maimed and bleeding men, as heedless as he of the dramatic\\r\\ncontrast between his laughter and their own ghastly gravity. To him it\\r\\nwas a merry spectacle. He had seen his father\\'s negroes creep upon their\\r\\nhands and knees for his amusement--had ridden them so, \"making believe\"\\r\\nthey were his horses. He now approached one of these crawling figures\\r\\nfrom behind and with an agile movement mounted it astride. The man sank\\r\\nupon his breast, recovered, flung the small boy fiercely to the ground\\r\\nas an unbroken colt might have done, then turned upon him a face that\\r\\nlacked a lower jaw--from the upper teeth to the throat was a great red\\r\\ngap fringed with hanging shreds of flesh and splinters of bone. The\\r\\nunnatural prominence of nose, the absence of chin, the fierce eyes, gave\\r\\nthis man the appearance of a great bird of prey crimsoned in throat and\\r\\nbreast by the blood of its quarry. The man rose to his knees, the child\\r\\nto his feet. The man shook his fist at the child; the child, terrified\\r\\nat last, ran to a tree near by, got upon the farther side of it and took\\r\\na more serious view of the situation. And so the clumsy multitude\\r\\ndragged itself slowly and painfully along in hideous pantomime--moved\\r\\nforward down the slope like a swarm of great black beetles, with never a\\r\\nsound of going--in silence profound, absolute.\\r\\n\\r\\nInstead of darkening, the haunted landscape began to brighten. Through\\r\\nthe belt of trees beyond the brook shone a strange red light, the trunks\\r\\nand branches of the trees making a black lacework against it. It struck\\r\\nthe creeping figures and gave them monstrous shadows, which caricatured\\r\\ntheir movements on the lit grass. It fell upon their faces, touching\\r\\ntheir whiteness with a ruddy tinge, accentuating the stains with which\\r\\nso many of them were freaked and maculated. It sparkled on buttons and\\r\\nbits of metal in their clothing. Instinctively the child turned toward\\r\\nthe growing splendor and moved down the slope with his horrible\\r\\ncompanions; in a few moments had passed the foremost of the throng--not\\r\\nmuch of a feat, considering his advantages. He placed himself in the\\r\\nlead, his wooden sword still in hand, and solemnly directed the march,\\r\\nconforming his pace to theirs and occasionally turning as if to see that\\r\\nhis forces did not straggle. Surely such a leader never before had such\\r\\na following.\\r\\n\\r\\nScattered about upon the ground now slowly narrowing by the encroachment\\r\\nof this awful march to water, were certain articles to which, in the\\r\\nleader\\'s mind, were coupled no significant associations: an occasional\\r\\nblanket, tightly rolled lengthwise, doubled and the ends bound together\\r\\nwith a string; a heavy knapsack here, and there a broken rifle--such\\r\\nthings, in short, as are found in the rear of retreating troops, the\\r\\n\"spoor\" of men flying from their hunters. Everywhere near the creek,\\r\\nwhich here had a margin of lowland, the earth was trodden into mud by\\r\\nthe feet of men and horses. An observer of better experience in the use\\r\\nof his eyes would have noticed that these footprints pointed in both\\r\\ndirections; the ground had been twice passed over--in advance and in\\r\\nretreat. A few hours before, these desperate, stricken men, with their\\r\\nmore fortunate and now distant comrades, had penetrated the forest in\\r\\nthousands. Their successive battalions, breaking into swarms and\\r\\nre-forming in lines, had passed the child on every side--had almost\\r\\ntrodden on him as he slept. The rustle and murmur of their march had not\\r\\nawakened him. Almost within a stone\\'s throw of where he lay they had\\r\\nfought a battle; but all unheard by him were the roar of the musketry,\\r\\nthe shock of the cannon, \"the thunder of the captains and the shouting.\"\\r\\nHe had slept through it all, grasping his little wooden sword with\\r\\nperhaps a tighter clutch in unconscious sympathy with his martial\\r\\nenvironment, but as heedless of the grandeur of the struggle as the dead\\r\\nwho had died to make the glory.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe fire beyond the belt of woods on the farther side of the creek,\\r\\nreflected to earth from the canopy of its own smoke, was now suffusing\\r\\nthe whole landscape. It transformed the sinuous line of mist to the\\r\\nvapor of gold. The water gleamed with dashes of red, and red, too, were\\r\\nmany of the stones protruding above the surface. But that was blood; the\\r\\nless desperately wounded had stained them in crossing. On them, too, the\\r\\nchild now crossed with eager steps; he was going to the fire. As he\\r\\nstood upon the farther bank he turned about to look at the companions of\\r\\nhis march. The advance was arriving at the creek. The stronger had\\r\\nalready drawn themselves to the brink and plunged their faces into the\\r\\nflood. Three or four who lay without motion appeared to have no heads.\\r\\nAt this the child\\'s eyes expanded with wonder; even his hospitable\\r\\nunderstanding could not accept a phenomenon implying such vitality as\\r\\nthat. After slaking their thirst these men had not had the strength to\\r\\nback away from the water, nor to keep their heads above it. They were\\r\\ndrowned. In rear of these, the open spaces of the forest showed the\\r\\nleader as many formless figures of his grim command as at first; but not\\r\\nnearly so many were in motion. He waved his cap for their encouragement\\r\\nand smilingly pointed with his weapon in the direction of the guiding\\r\\nlight--a pillar of fire to this strange exodus.\\r\\n\\r\\nConfident of the fidelity of his forces, he now entered the belt of\\r\\nwoods, passed through it easily in the red illumination, climbed a\\r\\nfence, ran across a field, turning now and again to coquet with his\\r\\nresponsive shadow, and so approached the blazing ruin of a dwelling.\\r\\nDesolation everywhere! In all the wide glare not a living thing was\\r\\nvisible. He cared nothing for that; the spectacle pleased, and he danced\\r\\nwith glee in imitation of the wavering flames. He ran about, collecting\\r\\nfuel, but every object that he found was too heavy for him to cast in\\r\\nfrom the distance to which the heat limited his approach. In despair he\\r\\nflung in his sword--a surrender to the superior forces of nature. His\\r\\nmilitary career was at an end.\\r\\n\\r\\nShifting his position, his eyes fell upon some outbuildings which had an\\r\\noddly familiar appearance, as if he had dreamed of them. He stood\\r\\nconsidering them with wonder, when suddenly the entire plantation, with\\r\\nits inclosing forest, seemed to turn as if upon a pivot. His little\\r\\nworld swung half around; the points of the compass were reversed. He\\r\\nrecognized the blazing building as his own home!\\r\\n\\r\\nFor a moment he stood stupefied by the power of the revelation, then ran\\r\\nwith stumbling feet, making a half-circuit of the ruin. There,\\r\\nconspicuous in the light of the conflagration, lay the dead body of a\\r\\nwoman--the white face turned upward, the hands thrown out and clutched\\r\\nfull of grass, the clothing deranged, the long dark hair in tangles and\\r\\nfull of clotted blood. The greater part of the forehead was torn away,\\r\\nand from the jagged hole the brain protruded, overflowing the temple, a\\r\\nfrothy mass of gray, crowned with clusters of crimson bubbles--the work\\r\\nof a shell.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe child moved his little hands, making wild, uncertain gestures. He\\r\\nuttered a series of inarticulate and indescribable cries--something\\r\\nbetween the chattering of an ape and the gobbling of a turkey--a\\r\\nstartling, soulless, unholy sound, the language of a devil. The child\\r\\nwas a deaf mute.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen he stood motionless, with quivering lips, looking down upon the\\r\\nwreck.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA SON OF THE GODS\\r\\n\\r\\nA STUDY IN THE PRESENT TENSE\\r\\n\\r\\nA breezy day and a sunny landscape. An open country to right and left\\r\\nand forward; behind, a wood. In the edge of this wood, facing the open\\r\\nbut not venturing into it, long lines of troops, halted. The wood is\\r\\nalive with them, and full of confused noises--the occasional rattle of\\r\\nwheels as a battery of artillery goes into position to cover the\\r\\nadvance; the hum and murmur of the soldiers talking; a sound of\\r\\ninnumerable feet in the dry leaves that strew the interspaces among the\\r\\ntrees; hoarse commands of officers. Detached groups of horsemen are well\\r\\nin front--not altogether exposed--many of them intently regarding the\\r\\ncrest of a hill a mile away in the direction of the interrupted advance.\\r\\nFor this powerful army, moving in battle order through a forest, has met\\r\\nwith a formidable obstacle--the open country. The crest of that gentle\\r\\nhill a mile away has a sinister look; it says, Beware! Along it runs a\\r\\nstone wall extending to left and right a great distance. Behind the wall\\r\\nis a hedge; behind the hedge are seen the tops of trees in rather\\r\\nstraggling order. Among the trees--what? It is necessary to know.\\r\\n\\r\\nYesterday, and for many days and nights previously, we were fighting\\r\\nsomewhere; always there was cannonading, with occasional keen rattlings\\r\\nof musketry, mingled with cheers, our own or the enemy\\'s, we seldom\\r\\nknew, attesting some temporary advantage. This morning at daybreak the\\r\\nenemy was gone. We have moved forward across his earthworks, across\\r\\nwhich we have so often vainly attempted to move before, through the\\r\\ndebris of his abandoned camps, among the graves of his fallen, into the\\r\\nwoods beyond.\\r\\n\\r\\nHow curiously we had regarded everything! how odd it all had seemed!\\r\\nNothing had appeared quite familiar; the most commonplace objects--an\\r\\nold saddle, a splintered wheel, a forgotten canteen--everything had\\r\\nrelated something of the mysterious personality of those strange men who\\r\\nhad been killing us. The soldier never becomes wholly familiar with the\\r\\nconception of his foes as men like himself; he cannot divest himself of\\r\\nthe feeling that they are another order of beings, differently\\r\\nconditioned, in an environment not altogether of the earth. The smallest\\r\\nvestiges of them rivet his attention and engage his interest. He thinks\\r\\nof them as inaccessible; and, catching an unexpected glimpse of them,\\r\\nthey appear farther away, and therefore larger, than they really are--\\r\\nlike objects in a fog. He is somewhat in awe of them.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom the edge of the wood leading up the acclivity are the tracks of\\r\\nhorses and wheels--the wheels of cannon. The yellow grass is beaten down\\r\\nby the feet of infantry. Clearly they have passed this way in thousands;\\r\\nthey have not withdrawn by the country roads. This is significant--it is\\r\\nthe difference between retiring and retreating.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat group of horsemen is our commander, his staff and escort. He is\\r\\nfacing the distant crest, holding his field-glass against his eyes with\\r\\nboth hands, his elbows needlessly elevated. It is a fashion; it seems to\\r\\ndignify the act; we are all addicted to it. Suddenly he lowers the glass\\r\\nand says a few words to those about him. Two or three aides detach\\r\\nthemselves from the group and canter away into the woods, along the\\r\\nlines in each direction. We did not hear his words, but we know them:\\r\\n\"Tell General X. to send forward the skirmish line.\" Those of us who\\r\\nhave been out of place resume our positions; the men resting at ease\\r\\nstraighten themselves and the ranks are re-formed without a command.\\r\\nSome of us staff officers dismount and look at our saddle girths; those\\r\\nalready on the ground remount.\\r\\n\\r\\nGalloping rapidly along in the edge of the open ground comes a young\\r\\nofficer on a snow-white horse. His saddle blanket is scarlet. What a\\r\\nfool! No one who has ever been in action but remembers how naturally\\r\\nevery rifle turns toward the man on a white horse; no one but has\\r\\nobserved how a bit of red enrages the bull of battle. That such colors\\r\\nare fashionable in military life must be accepted as the most\\r\\nastonishing of all the phenomena of human vanity. They would seem to\\r\\nhave been devised to increase the death-rate.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis young officer is in full uniform, as if on parade. He is all agleam\\r\\nwith bullion--a blue-and-gold edition of the Poetry of War. A wave of\\r\\nderisive laughter runs abreast of him all along the line. But how\\r\\nhandsome he is!--with what careless grace he sits his horse!\\r\\n\\r\\nHe reins up within a respectful distance of the corps commander and\\r\\nsalutes. The old soldier nods familiarly; he evidently knows him. A\\r\\nbrief colloquy between them is going on; the young man seems to be\\r\\npreferring some request which the elder one is indisposed to grant. Let\\r\\nus ride a little nearer. Ah! too late--it is ended. The young officer\\r\\nsalutes again, wheels his horse, and rides straight toward the crest of\\r\\nthe hill!\\r\\n\\r\\nA thin line of skirmishers, the men deployed at six paces or so apart,\\r\\nnow pushes from the wood into the open. The commander speaks to his\\r\\nbugler, who claps his instrument to his lips. _Tra-la-la! Tra-la-la!_\\r\\nThe skirmishers halt in their tracks.\\r\\n\\r\\nMeantime the young horseman has advanced a hundred yards. He is riding\\r\\nat a walk, straight up the long slope, with never a turn of the head.\\r\\nHow glorious! Gods! what would we not give to be in his place--with his\\r\\nsoul! He does not draw his sabre; his right hand hangs easily at his\\r\\nside. The breeze catches the plume in his hat and flutters it smartly.\\r\\nThe sunshine rests upon his shoulder-straps, lovingly, like a visible\\r\\nbenediction. Straight on he rides. Ten thousand pairs of eyes are fixed\\r\\nupon him with an intensity that he can hardly fail to feel; ten thousand\\r\\nhearts keep quick time to the inaudible hoof-beats of his snowy steed.\\r\\nHe is not alone--he draws all souls after him. But we remember that we\\r\\nlaughed! On and on, straight for the hedge-lined wall, he rides. Not a\\r\\nlook backward. O, if he would but turn--if he could but see the love,\\r\\nthe adoration, the atonement!\\r\\n\\r\\nNot a word is spoken; the populous depths of the forest still murmur\\r\\nwith their unseen and unseeing swarm, but all along the fringe is\\r\\nsilence. The burly commander is an equestrian statue of himself. The\\r\\nmounted staff officers, their field glasses up, are motionless all. The\\r\\nline of battle in the edge of the wood stands at a new kind of\\r\\n\"attention,\" each man in the attitude in which he was caught by the\\r\\nconsciousness of what is going on. All these hardened and impenitent\\r\\nman-killers, to whom death in its awfulest forms is a fact familiar to\\r\\ntheir every-day observation; who sleep on hills trembling with the\\r\\nthunder of great guns, dine in the midst of streaming missiles, and play\\r\\nat cards among the dead faces of their dearest friends--all are watching\\r\\nwith suspended breath and beating hearts the outcome of an act involving\\r\\nthe life of one man. Such is the magnetism of courage and devotion.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf now you should turn your head you would see a simultaneous movement\\r\\namong the spectators--a start, as if they had received an electric\\r\\nshock--and looking forward again to the now distant horseman you would\\r\\nsee that he has in that instant altered his direction and is riding at\\r\\nan angle to his former course. The spectators suppose the sudden\\r\\ndeflection to be caused by a shot, perhaps a wound; but take this\\r\\nfield-glass and you will observe that he is riding toward a break in the\\r\\nwall and hedge. He means, if not killed, to ride through and overlook\\r\\nthe country beyond.\\r\\n\\r\\nYou are not to forget the nature of this man\\'s act; it is not permitted\\r\\nto you to think of it as an instance of bravado, nor, on the other hand,\\r\\na needless sacrifice of self. If the enemy has not retreated he is in\\r\\nforce on that ridge. The investigator will encounter nothing less than a\\r\\nline-of-battle; there is no need of pickets, videttes, skirmishers, to\\r\\ngive warning of our approach; our attacking lines will be visible,\\r\\nconspicuous, exposed to an artillery fire that will shave the ground the\\r\\nmoment they break from cover, and for half the distance to a sheet of\\r\\nrifle bullets in which nothing can live. In short, if the enemy is\\r\\nthere, it would be madness to attack him in front; he must be manoeuvred\\r\\nout by the immemorial plan of threatening his line of communication, as\\r\\nnecessary to his existence as to the diver at the bottom of the sea his\\r\\nair tube. But how ascertain if the enemy is there? There is but one\\r\\nway,--somebody must go and see. The natural and customary thing to do is\\r\\nto send forward a line of skirmishers. But in this case they will answer\\r\\nin the affirmative with all their lives; the enemy, crouching in double\\r\\nranks behind the stone wall and in cover of the hedge, will wait until\\r\\nit is possible to count each assailant\\'s teeth. At the first volley a\\r\\nhalf of the questioning line will fall, the other half before it can\\r\\naccomplish the predestined retreat. What a price to pay for gratified\\r\\ncuriosity! At what a dear rate an army must sometimes purchase\\r\\nknowledge! \"Let me pay all,\" says this gallant man--this military\\r\\nChrist!\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is no hope except the hope against hope that the crest is clear.\\r\\nTrue, he might prefer capture to death. So long as he advances, the line\\r\\nwill not fire--why should it? He can safely ride into the hostile ranks\\r\\nand become a prisoner of war. But this would defeat his object. It would\\r\\nnot answer our question; it is necessary either that he return unharmed\\r\\nor be shot to death before our eyes. Only so shall we know how to act.\\r\\nIf captured--why, that might have been done by a half-dozen stragglers.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow begins an extraordinary contest of intellect between a man and an\\r\\narmy. Our horseman, now within a quarter of a mile of the crest,\\r\\nsuddenly wheels to the left and gallops in a direction parallel to it.\\r\\nHe has caught sight of his antagonist; he knows all. Some slight\\r\\nadvantage of ground has enabled him to overlook a part of the line. If\\r\\nhe were here he could tell us in words. But that is now hopeless; he\\r\\nmust make the best use of the few minutes of life remaining to him, by\\r\\ncompelling the enemy himself to tell us as much and as plainly as\\r\\npossible--which, naturally, that discreet power is reluctant to do. Not\\r\\na rifleman in those crouching ranks, not a cannoneer at those masked and\\r\\nshotted guns, but knows the needs of the situation, the imperative duty\\r\\nof forbearance. Besides, there has been time enough to forbid them all\\r\\nto fire. True, a single rifle-shot might drop him and be no great\\r\\ndisclosure. But firing is infectious--and see how rapidly he moves, with\\r\\nnever a pause except as he whirls his horse about to take a new\\r\\ndirection, never directly backward toward us, never directly forward\\r\\ntoward his executioners. All this is visible through the glass; it seems\\r\\noccurring within pistol-shot; we see all but the enemy, whose presence,\\r\\nwhose thoughts, whose motives we infer. To the unaided eye there is\\r\\nnothing but a black figure on a white horse, tracing slow zigzags\\r\\nagainst the slope of a distant hill--so slowly they seem almost to\\r\\ncreep.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow--the glass again--he has tired of his failure, or sees his error, or\\r\\nhas gone mad; he is dashing directly forward at the wall, as if to take\\r\\nit at a leap, hedge and all! One moment only and he wheels right about\\r\\nand is speeding like the wind straight down the slope--toward his\\r\\nfriends, toward his death! Instantly the wall is topped with a fierce\\r\\nroll of smoke for a distance of hundreds of yards to right and left.\\r\\nThis is as instantly dissipated by the wind, and before the rattle of\\r\\nthe rifles reaches us he is down. No, he recovers his seat; he has but\\r\\npulled his horse upon its haunches. They are up and away! A tremendous\\r\\ncheer bursts from our ranks, relieving the insupportable tension of our\\r\\nfeelings. And the horse and its rider? Yes, they are up and away. Away,\\r\\nindeed--they are making directly to our left, parallel to the now\\r\\nsteadily blazing and smoking wall. The rattle of the musketry is\\r\\ncontinuous, and every bullet\\'s target is that courageous heart.\\r\\n\\r\\nSuddenly a great bank of white smoke pushes upward from behind the wall.\\r\\nAnother and another--a dozen roll up before the thunder of the\\r\\nexplosions and the humming of the missiles reach our ears and the\\r\\nmissiles themselves come bounding through clouds of dust into our\\r\\ncovert, knocking over here and there a man and causing a temporary\\r\\ndistraction, a passing thought of self.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe dust drifts away. Incredible!--that enchanted horse and rider have\\r\\npassed a ravine and are climbing another slope to unveil another\\r\\nconspiracy of silence, to thwart the will of another armed host. Another\\r\\nmoment and that crest too is in eruption. The horse rears and strikes\\r\\nthe air with its forefeet. They are down at last. But look again--the\\r\\nman has detached himself from the dead animal. He stands erect,\\r\\nmotionless, holding his sabre in his right hand straight above his head.\\r\\nHis face is toward us. Now he lowers his hand to a level with his face\\r\\nand moves it outward, the blade of the sabre describing a downward\\r\\ncurve. It is a sign to us, to the world, to posterity. It is a hero\\'s\\r\\nsalute to death and history.\\r\\n\\r\\nAgain the spell is broken; our men attempt to cheer; they are choking\\r\\nwith emotion; they utter hoarse, discordant cries; they clutch their\\r\\nweapons and press tumultuously forward into the open. The skirmishers,\\r\\nwithout orders, against orders, are going forward at a keen run, like\\r\\nhounds unleashed. Our cannon speak and the enemy\\'s now open in full\\r\\nchorus; to right and left as far as we can see, the distant crest,\\r\\nseeming now so near, erects its towers of cloud and the great shot pitch\\r\\nroaring down among our moving masses. Flag after flag of ours emerges\\r\\nfrom the wood, line after line sweeps forth, catching the sunlight on\\r\\nits burnished arms. The rear battalions alone are in obedience; they\\r\\npreserve their proper distance from the insurgent front.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe commander has not moved. He now removes his field-glass from his\\r\\neyes and glances to the right and left. He sees the human current\\r\\nflowing on either side of him and his huddled escort, like tide waves\\r\\nparted by a rock. Not a sign of feeling in his face; he is thinking.\\r\\nAgain he directs his eyes forward; they slowly traverse that malign and\\r\\nawful crest. He addresses a calm word to his bugler. _Tra-la-la!\\r\\nTra-la-la!_ The injunction has an imperiousness which enforces it. It is\\r\\nrepeated by all the bugles of all the sub-ordinate commanders; the sharp\\r\\nmetallic notes assert themselves above the hum of the advance and\\r\\npenetrate the sound of the cannon. To halt is to withdraw. The colors\\r\\nmove slowly back; the lines face about and sullenly follow, bearing\\r\\ntheir wounded; the skirmishers return, gathering up the dead.\\r\\n\\r\\nAh, those many, many needless dead! That great soul whose beautiful body\\r\\nis lying over yonder, so conspicuous against the sere hillside--could it\\r\\nnot have been spared the bitter consciousness of a vain devotion? Would\\r\\none exception have marred too much the pitiless perfection of the\\r\\ndivine, eternal plan?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nONE OF THE MISSING\\r\\n\\r\\nJerome Searing, a private soldier of General Sherman\\'s army, then\\r\\nconfronting the enemy at and about Kennesaw Mountain, Georgia, turned\\r\\nhis back upon a small group of officers with whom he had been talking in\\r\\nlow tones, stepped across a light line of earthworks, and disappeared in\\r\\na forest. None of the men in line behind the works had said a word to\\r\\nhim, nor had he so much as nodded to them in passing, but all who saw\\r\\nunderstood that this brave man had been intrusted with some perilous\\r\\nduty. Jerome Searing, though a private, did not serve in the ranks; he\\r\\nwas detailed for service at division headquarters, being borne upon the\\r\\nrolls as an orderly. \"Orderly\" is a word covering a multitude of duties.\\r\\nAn orderly may be a messenger, a clerk, an officer\\'s servant--anything.\\r\\nHe may perform services for which no provision is made in orders and\\r\\narmy regulations. Their nature may depend upon his aptitude, upon favor,\\r\\nupon accident. Private Searing, an incomparable marksman, young, hardy,\\r\\nintelligent and insensible to fear, was a scout. The general commanding\\r\\nhis division was not content to obey orders blindly without knowing what\\r\\nwas in his front, even when his command was not on detached service, but\\r\\nformed a fraction of the line of the army; nor was he satisfied to\\r\\nreceive his knowledge of his _vis-\\xc3\\xa0-vis_ through the customary channels;\\r\\nhe wanted to know more than he was apprised of by the corps commander\\r\\nand the collisions of pickets and skirmishers. Hence Jerome Searing,\\r\\nwith his extraordinary daring, his woodcraft, his sharp eyes, and\\r\\ntruthful tongue. On this occasion his instructions were simple: to get\\r\\nas near the enemy\\'s lines as possible and learn all that he could.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn a few moments he had arrived at the picket-line, the men on duty\\r\\nthere lying in groups of two and four behind little banks of earth\\r\\nscooped out of the slight depression in which they lay, their rifles\\r\\nprotruding from the green boughs with which they had masked their small\\r\\ndefenses. The forest extended without a break toward the front, so\\r\\nsolemn and silent that only by an effort of the imagination could it be\\r\\nconceived as populous with armed men, alert and vigilant--a forest\\r\\nformidable with possibilities of battle. Pausing a moment in one of\\r\\nthese rifle-pits to apprise the men of his intention Searing crept\\r\\nstealthily forward on his hands and knees and was soon lost to view in a\\r\\ndense thicket of underbrush.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That is the last of him,\" said one of the men; \"I wish I had his rifle;\\r\\nthose fellows will hurt some of us with it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSearing crept on, taking advantage of every accident of ground and\\r\\ngrowth to give himself better cover. His eyes penetrated everywhere, his\\r\\nears took note of every sound. He stilled his breathing, and at the\\r\\ncracking of a twig beneath his knee stopped his progress and hugged the\\r\\nearth. It was slow work, but not tedious; the danger made it exciting,\\r\\nbut by no physical signs was the excitement manifest. His pulse was as\\r\\nregular, his nerves were as steady as if he were trying to trap a\\r\\nsparrow.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It seems a long time,\" he thought, \"but I cannot have come very far; I\\r\\nam still alive.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe smiled at his own method of estimating distance, and crept forward. A\\r\\nmoment later he suddenly flattened himself upon the earth and lay\\r\\nmotionless, minute after minute. Through a narrow opening in the bushes\\r\\nhe had caught sight of a small mound of yellow clay--one of the enemy\\'s\\r\\nrifle-pits. After some little time he cautiously raised his head, inch\\r\\nby inch, then his body upon his hands, spread out on each side of him,\\r\\nall the while intently regarding the hillock of clay. In another moment\\r\\nhe was upon his feet, rifle in hand, striding rapidly forward with\\r\\nlittle attempt at concealment. He had rightly interpreted the signs,\\r\\nwhatever they were; the enemy was gone.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo assure himself beyond a doubt before going back to report upon so\\r\\nimportant a matter, Searing pushed forward across the line of abandoned\\r\\npits, running from cover to cover in the more open forest, his eyes\\r\\nvigilant to discover possible stragglers. He came to the edge of a\\r\\nplantation--one of those forlorn, deserted homesteads of the last years\\r\\nof the war, upgrown with brambles, ugly with broken fences and desolate\\r\\nwith vacant buildings having blank apertures in place of doors and\\r\\nwindows. After a keen reconnoissance from the safe seclusion of a clump\\r\\nof young pines Searing ran lightly across a field and through an orchard\\r\\nto a small structure which stood apart from the other farm buildings, on\\r\\na slight elevation. This he thought would enable him to overlook a large\\r\\nscope of country in the direction that he supposed the enemy to have\\r\\ntaken in withdrawing. This building, which had originally consisted of a\\r\\nsingle room elevated upon four posts about ten feet high, was now little\\r\\nmore than a roof; the floor had fallen away, the joists and planks\\r\\nloosely piled on the ground below or resting on end at various angles,\\r\\nnot wholly torn from their fastenings above. The supporting posts were\\r\\nthemselves no longer vertical. It looked as if the whole edifice would\\r\\ngo down at the touch of a finger.\\r\\n\\r\\nConcealing himself in the debris of joists and flooring Searing looked\\r\\nacross the open ground between his point of view and a spur of Kennesaw\\r\\nMountain, a half-mile away. A road leading up and across this spur was\\r\\ncrowded with troops--the rear-guard of the retiring enemy, their\\r\\ngun-barrels gleaming in the morning sunlight.\\r\\n\\r\\nSearing had now learned all that he could hope to know. It was his duty\\r\\nto return to his own command with all possible speed and report his\\r\\ndiscovery. But the gray column of Confederates toiling up the mountain\\r\\nroad was singularly tempting. His rifle--an ordinary \"Springfield,\" but\\r\\nfitted with a globe sight and hair-trigger--would easily send its ounce\\r\\nand a quarter of lead hissing into their midst. That would probably not\\r\\naffect the duration and result of the war, but it is the business of a\\r\\nsoldier to kill. It is also his habit if he is a good soldier. Searing\\r\\ncocked his rifle and \"set\" the trigger.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut it was decreed from the beginning of time that Private Searing was\\r\\nnot to murder anybody that bright summer morning, nor was the\\r\\nConfederate retreat to be announced by him. For countless ages events\\r\\nhad been so matching themselves together in that wondrous mosaic to some\\r\\nparts of which, dimly discernible, we give the name of history, that the\\r\\nacts which he had in will would have marred the harmony of the pattern.\\r\\nSome twenty-five years previously the Power charged with the execution\\r\\nof the work according to the design had provided against that mischance\\r\\nby causing the birth of a certain male child in a little village at the\\r\\nfoot of the Carpathian Mountains, had carefully reared it, supervised\\r\\nits education, directed its desires into a military channel, and in due\\r\\ntime made it an officer of artillery. By the concurrence of an infinite\\r\\nnumber of favoring influences and their preponderance over an infinite\\r\\nnumber of opposing ones, this officer of artillery had been made to\\r\\ncommit a breach of discipline and flee from his native country to avoid\\r\\npunishment. He had been directed to New Orleans (instead of New York),\\r\\nwhere a recruiting officer awaited him on the wharf. He was enlisted and\\r\\npromoted, and things were so ordered that he now commanded a Confederate\\r\\nbattery some two miles along the line from where Jerome Searing, the\\r\\nFederal scout, stood cocking his rifle. Nothing had been neglected--at\\r\\nevery step in the progress of both these men\\'s lives, and in the lives\\r\\nof their contemporaries and ancestors, and in the lives of the\\r\\ncontemporaries of their ancestors, the right thing had been done to\\r\\nbring about the desired result. Had anything in all this vast\\r\\nconcatenation been overlooked Private Searing might have fired on the\\r\\nretreating Confederates that morning, and would perhaps have missed. As\\r\\nit fell out, a Confederate captain of artillery, having nothing better\\r\\nto do while awaiting his turn to pull out and be off, amused himself by\\r\\nsighting a field-piece obliquely to his right at what he mistook for\\r\\nsome Federal officers on the crest of a hill, and discharged it. The\\r\\nshot flew high of its mark.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs Jerome Searing drew back the hammer of his rifle and with his eyes\\r\\nupon the distant Confederates considered where he could plant his shot\\r\\nwith the best hope of making a widow or an orphan or a childless\\r\\nmother,--perhaps all three, for Private Searing, although he had\\r\\nrepeatedly refused promotion, was not without a certain kind of\\r\\nambition,--he heard a rushing sound in the air, like that made by the\\r\\nwings of a great bird swooping down upon its prey. More quickly than he\\r\\ncould apprehend the gradation, it increased to a hoarse and horrible\\r\\nroar, as the missile that made it sprang at him out of the sky, striking\\r\\nwith a deafening impact one of the posts supporting the confusion of\\r\\ntimbers above him, smashing it into matchwood, and bringing down the\\r\\ncrazy edifice with a loud clatter, in clouds of blinding dust!\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Jerome Searing recovered consciousness he did not at once\\r\\nunderstand what had occurred. It was, indeed, some time before he opened\\r\\nhis eyes. For a while he believed that he had died and been buried, and\\r\\nhe tried to recall some portions of the burial service. He thought that\\r\\nhis wife was kneeling upon his grave, adding her weight to that of the\\r\\nearth upon his breast. The two of them, widow and earth, had crushed his\\r\\ncoffin. Unless the children should persuade her to go home he would not\\r\\nmuch longer be able to breathe. He felt a sense of wrong. \"I cannot\\r\\nspeak to her,\" he thought; \"the dead have no voice; and if I open my\\r\\neyes I shall get them full of earth.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe opened his eyes. A great expanse of blue sky, rising from a fringe of\\r\\nthe tops of trees. In the foreground, shutting out some of the trees, a\\r\\nhigh, dun mound, angular in outline and crossed by an intricate,\\r\\npatternless system of straight lines; the whole an immeasurable distance\\r\\naway--a distance so inconceivably great that it fatigued him, and he\\r\\nclosed his eyes. The moment that he did so he was conscious of an\\r\\ninsufferable light. A sound was in his ears like the low, rhythmic\\r\\nthunder of a distant sea breaking in successive waves upon the beach,\\r\\nand out of this noise, seeming a part of it, or possibly coming from\\r\\nbeyond it, and intermingled with its ceaseless undertone, came the\\r\\narticulate words: \"Jerome Searing, you are caught like a rat in a trap--\\r\\nin a trap, trap, trap.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSuddenly there fell a great silence, a black darkness, an infinite\\r\\ntranquillity, and Jerome Searing, perfectly conscious of his rathood,\\r\\nand well assured of the trap that he was in, remembering all and nowise\\r\\nalarmed, again opened his eyes to reconnoitre, to note the strength of\\r\\nhis enemy, to plan his defense.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was caught in a reclining posture, his back firmly supported by a\\r\\nsolid beam. Another lay across his breast, but he had been able to\\r\\nshrink a little away from it so that it no longer oppressed him, though\\r\\nit was immovable. A brace joining it at an angle had wedged him against\\r\\na pile of boards on his left, fastening the arm on that side. His legs,\\r\\nslightly parted and straight along the ground, were covered upward to\\r\\nthe knees with a mass of debris which towered above his narrow horizon.\\r\\nHis head was as rigidly fixed as in a vise; he could move his eyes, his\\r\\nchin--no more. Only his right arm was partly free. \"You must help us out\\r\\nof this,\" he said to it. But he could not get it from under the heavy\\r\\ntimber athwart his chest, nor move it outward more than six inches at\\r\\nthe elbow.\\r\\n\\r\\nSearing was not seriously injured, nor did he suffer pain. A smart rap\\r\\non the head from a flying fragment of the splintered post, incurred\\r\\nsimultaneously with the frightfully sudden shock to the nervous system,\\r\\nhad momentarily dazed him. His term of unconsciousness, including the\\r\\nperiod of recovery, during which he had had the strange fancies, had\\r\\nprobably not exceeded a few seconds, for the dust of the wreck had not\\r\\nwholly cleared away as he began an intelligent survey of the situation.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith his partly free right hand he now tried to get hold of the beam\\r\\nthat lay across, but not quite against, his breast. In no way could he\\r\\ndo so. He was unable to depress the shoulder so as to push the elbow\\r\\nbeyond that edge of the timber which was nearest his knees; failing in\\r\\nthat, he could not raise the forearm and hand to grasp the beam. The\\r\\nbrace that made an angle with it downward and backward prevented him\\r\\nfrom doing anything in that direction, and between it and his body the\\r\\nspace was not half so wide as the length of his forearm. Obviously he\\r\\ncould not get his hand under the beam nor over it; the hand could not,\\r\\nin fact, touch it at all. Having demonstrated his inability, he\\r\\ndesisted, and began to think whether he could reach any of the d\\xc3\\xa9bris\\r\\npiled upon his legs.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn surveying the mass with a view to determining that point, his\\r\\nattention was arrested by what seemed to be a ring of shining metal\\r\\nimmediately in front of his eyes. It appeared to him at first to\\r\\nsurround some perfectly black substance, and it was somewhat more than a\\r\\nhalf-inch in diameter. It suddenly occurred to his mind that the\\r\\nblackness was simply shadow and that the ring was in fact the muzzle of\\r\\nhis rifle protruding from the pile of d\\xc3\\xa9bris. He was not long in\\r\\nsatisfying himself that this was so--if it was a satisfaction. By\\r\\nclosing either eye he could look a little way along the barrel--to the\\r\\npoint where it was hidden by the rubbish that held it. He could see the\\r\\none side, with the corresponding eye, at apparently the same angle as\\r\\nthe other side with the other eye. Looking with the right eye, the\\r\\nweapon seemed to be directed at a point to the left of his head, and\\r\\n_vice-versa._ He was unable to see the upper surface of the barrel, but\\r\\ncould see the under surface of the stock at a slight angle. The piece\\r\\nwas, in fact, aimed at the exact centre of his forehead.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the perception of this circumstance, in the recollection that just\\r\\npreviously to the mischance of which this uncomfortable situation was\\r\\nthe result he had cocked the rifle and set the trigger so that a touch\\r\\nwould discharge it, Private Searing was affected with a feeling of\\r\\nuneasiness. But that was as far as possible from fear; he was a brave\\r\\nman, somewhat familiar with the aspect of rifles from that point of\\r\\nview, and of cannon too. And now he recalled, with something like\\r\\namusement, an incident of his experience at the storming of Missionary\\r\\nRidge, where, walking up to one of the enemy\\'s embrasures from which he\\r\\nhad seen a heavy gun throw charge after charge of grape among the\\r\\nassailants he had thought for a moment that the piece had been\\r\\nwithdrawn; he could see nothing in the opening but a brazen circle. What\\r\\nthat was he had understood just in time to step aside as it pitched\\r\\nanother peck of iron down that swarming slope. To face firearms is one\\r\\nof the commonest incidents in a soldier\\'s life--firearms, too, with\\r\\nmalevolent eyes blazing behind them. That is what a soldier is for.\\r\\nStill, Private Searing did not altogether relish the situation, and\\r\\nturned away his eyes.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter groping, aimless, with his right hand for a time he made an\\r\\nineffectual attempt to release his left. Then he tried to disengage his\\r\\nhead, the fixity of which was the more annoying from his ignorance of\\r\\nwhat held it. Next he tried to free his feet, but while exerting the\\r\\npowerful muscles of his legs for that purpose it occurred to him that a\\r\\ndisturbance of the rubbish which held them might discharge the rifle;\\r\\nhow it could have endured what had already befallen it he could not\\r\\nunderstand, although memory assisted him with several instances in\\r\\npoint. One in particular he recalled, in which in a moment of mental\\r\\nabstraction he had clubbed his rifle and beaten out another gentleman\\'s\\r\\nbrains, observing afterward that the weapon which he had been diligently\\r\\nswinging by the muzzle was loaded, capped, and at full cock--knowledge\\r\\nof which circumstance would doubtless have cheered his antagonist to\\r\\nlonger endurance. He had always smiled in recalling that blunder of his\\r\\n\"green and salad days\" as a soldier, but now he did not smile. He turned\\r\\nhis eyes again to the muzzle of the rifle and for a moment fancied that\\r\\nit had moved; it seemed somewhat nearer.\\r\\n\\r\\nAgain he looked away. The tops of the distant trees beyond the bounds of\\r\\nthe plantation interested him: he had not before observed how light and\\r\\nfeathery they were, nor how darkly blue the sky was, even among their\\r\\nbranches, where they somewhat paled it with their green; above him it\\r\\nappeared almost black. \"It will be uncomfortably hot here,\" he thought,\\r\\n\"as the day advances. I wonder which way I am looking.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nJudging by such shadows as he could see, he decided that his face was\\r\\ndue north; he would at least not have the sun in his eyes, and north--\\r\\nwell, that was toward his wife and children.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Bah!\" he exclaimed aloud, \"what have they to do with it?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe closed his eyes. \"As I can\\'t get out I may as well go to sleep. The\\r\\nrebels are gone and some of our fellows are sure to stray out here\\r\\nforaging. They\\'ll find me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBut he did not sleep. Gradually he became sensible of a pain in his\\r\\nforehead--a dull ache, hardly perceptible at first, but growing more and\\r\\nmore uncomfortable. He opened his eyes and it was gone--closed them and\\r\\nit returned. \"The devil!\" he said, irrelevantly, and stared again at the\\r\\nsky. He heard the singing of birds, the strange metallic note of the\\r\\nmeadow lark, suggesting the clash of vibrant blades. He fell into\\r\\npleasant memories of his childhood, played again with his brother and\\r\\nsister, raced across the fields, shouting to alarm the sedentary larks,\\r\\nentered the sombre forest beyond and with timid steps followed the faint\\r\\npath to Ghost Rock, standing at last with audible heart-throbs before\\r\\nthe Dead Man\\'s Cave and seeking to penetrate its awful mystery. For the\\r\\nfirst time he observed that the opening of the haunted cavern was\\r\\nencircled by a ring of metal. Then all else vanished and left him gazing\\r\\ninto the barrel of his rifle as before. But whereas before it had seemed\\r\\nnearer, it now seemed an inconceivable distance away, and all the more\\r\\nsinister for that. He cried out and, startled by something in his own\\r\\nvoice--the note of fear--lied to himself in denial: \"If I don\\'t sing out\\r\\nI may stay here till I die.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe now made no further attempt to evade the menacing stare of the gun\\r\\nbarrel. If he turned away his eyes an instant it was to look for\\r\\nassistance (although he could not see the ground on either side the\\r\\nruin), and he permitted them to return, obedient to the imperative\\r\\nfascination. If he closed them it was from weariness, and instantly the\\r\\npoignant pain in his forehead--the prophecy and menace of the bullet--\\r\\nforced him to reopen them.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe tension of nerve and brain was too severe; nature came to his relief\\r\\nwith intervals of unconsciousness. Reviving from one of these he became\\r\\nsensible of a sharp, smarting pain in his right hand, and when he worked\\r\\nhis fingers together, or rubbed his palm with them, he could feel that\\r\\nthey were wet and slippery. He could not see the hand, but he knew the\\r\\nsensation; it was running blood. In his delirium he had beaten it\\r\\nagainst the jagged fragments of the wreck, had clutched it full of\\r\\nsplinters. He resolved that he would meet his fate more manly. He was a\\r\\nplain, common soldier, had no religion and not much philosophy; he could\\r\\nnot die like a hero, with great and wise last words, even if there had\\r\\nbeen some one to hear them, but he could die \"game,\" and he would. But\\r\\nif he could only know when to expect the shot!\\r\\n\\r\\nSome rats which had probably inhabited the shed came sneaking and\\r\\nscampering about. One of them mounted the pile of d\\xc3\\xa9bris that held the\\r\\nrifle; another followed and another. Searing regarded them at first with\\r\\nindifference, then with friendly interest; then, as the thought flashed\\r\\ninto his bewildered mind that they might touch the trigger of his rifle,\\r\\nhe cursed them and ordered them to go away. \"It is no business of\\r\\nyours,\" he cried.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe creatures went away; they would return later, attack his face, gnaw\\r\\naway his nose, cut his throat--he knew that, but he hoped by that time\\r\\nto be dead.\\r\\n\\r\\nNothing could now unfix his gaze from the little ring of metal with its\\r\\nblack interior. The pain in his forehead was fierce and incessant. He\\r\\nfelt it gradually penetrating the brain more and more deeply, until at\\r\\nlast its progress was arrested by the wood at the back of his head. It\\r\\ngrew momentarily more insufferable: he began wantonly beating his\\r\\nlacerated hand against the splinters again to counteract that horrible\\r\\nache. It seemed to throb with a slow, regular recurrence, each pulsation\\r\\nsharper than the preceding, and sometimes he cried out, thinking he felt\\r\\nthe fatal bullet. No thoughts of home, of wife and children, of country,\\r\\nof glory. The whole record of memory was effaced. The world had passed\\r\\naway--not a vestige remained. Here in this confusion of timbers and\\r\\nboards is the sole universe. Here is immortality in time--each pain an\\r\\neverlasting life. The throbs tick off eternities.\\r\\n\\r\\nJerome Searing, the man of courage, the formidable enemy, the strong,\\r\\nresolute warrior, was as pale as a ghost. His jaw was fallen; his eyes\\r\\nprotruded; he trembled in every fibre; a cold sweat bathed his entire\\r\\nbody; he screamed with fear. He was not insane--he was terrified.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn groping about with his torn and bleeding hand he seized at last a\\r\\nstrip of board, and, pulling, felt it give way. It lay parallel with his\\r\\nbody, and by bending his elbow as much as the contracted space would\\r\\npermit, he could draw it a few inches at a time. Finally it was\\r\\naltogether loosened from the wreckage covering his legs; he could lift\\r\\nit clear of the ground its whole length. A great hope came into his\\r\\nmind: perhaps he could work it upward, that is to say backward, far\\r\\nenough to lift the end and push aside the rifle; or, if that were too\\r\\ntightly wedged, so place the strip of board as to deflect the bullet.\\r\\nWith this object he passed it backward inch by inch, hardly daring to\\r\\nbreathe lest that act somehow defeat his intent, and more than ever\\r\\nunable to remove his eyes from the rifle, which might perhaps now hasten\\r\\nto improve its waning opportunity. Something at least had been gained:\\r\\nin the occupation of his mind in this attempt at self-defense he was\\r\\nless sensible of the pain in his head and had ceased to wince. But he\\r\\nwas still dreadfully frightened and his teeth rattled like castanets.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe strip of board ceased to move to the suasion of his hand. He tugged\\r\\nat it with all his strength, changed the direction of its length all he\\r\\ncould, but it had met some extended obstruction behind him and the end\\r\\nin front was still too far away to clear the pile of d\\xc3\\xa9bris and reach\\r\\nthe muzzle of the gun. It extended, indeed, nearly as far as the trigger\\r\\nguard, which, uncovered by the rubbish, he could imperfectly see with\\r\\nhis right eye. He tried to break the strip with his hand, but had no\\r\\nleverage. In his defeat, all his terror returned, augmented tenfold. The\\r\\nblack aperture of the rifle appeared to threaten a sharper and more\\r\\nimminent death in punishment of his rebellion. The track of the bullet\\r\\nthrough his head ached with an intenser anguish. He began to tremble\\r\\nagain.\\r\\n\\r\\nSuddenly he became composed. His tremor subsided. He clenched his teeth\\r\\nand drew down his eyebrows. He had not exhausted his means of defense; a\\r\\nnew design had shaped itself in his mind--another plan of battle.\\r\\nRaising the front end of the strip of board, he carefully pushed it\\r\\nforward through the wreckage at the side of the rifle until it pressed\\r\\nagainst the trigger guard. Then he moved the end slowly outward until he\\r\\ncould feel that it had cleared it, then, closing his eyes, thrust it\\r\\nagainst the trigger with all his strength! There was no explosion; the\\r\\nrifle had been discharged as it dropped from his hand when the building\\r\\nfell. But it did its work.\\r\\n\\r\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\r\\n\\r\\nLieutenant Adrian Searing, in command of the picket-guard on that part\\r\\nof the line through which his brother Jerome had passed on his mission,\\r\\nsat with attentive ears in his breastwork behind the line. Not the\\r\\nfaintest sound escaped him; the cry of a bird, the barking of a\\r\\nsquirrel, the noise of the wind among the pines--all were anxiously\\r\\nnoted by his overstrained sense. Suddenly, directly in front of his\\r\\nline, he heard a faint, confused rumble, like the clatter of a falling\\r\\nbuilding translated by distance. The lieutenant mechanically looked at\\r\\nhis watch. Six o\\'clock and eighteen minutes. At the same moment an\\r\\nofficer approached him on foot from the rear and saluted.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Lieutenant,\" said the officer, \"the colonel directs you to move forward\\r\\nyour line and feel the enemy if you find him. If not, continue the\\r\\nadvance until directed to halt. There is reason to think that the enemy\\r\\nhas retreated.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe lieutenant nodded and said nothing; the other officer retired. In a\\r\\nmoment the men, apprised of their duty by the non-commissioned officers\\r\\nin low tones, had deployed from their rifle-pits and were moving forward\\r\\nin skirmishing order, with set teeth and beating hearts.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis line of skirmishers sweeps across the plantation toward the\\r\\nmountain. They pass on both sides of the wrecked building, observing\\r\\nnothing. At a short distance in their rear their commander comes. He\\r\\ncasts his eyes curiously upon the ruin and sees a dead body half buried\\r\\nin boards and timbers. It is so covered with dust that its clothing is\\r\\nConfederate gray. Its face is yellowish white; the cheeks are fallen in,\\r\\nthe temples sunken, too, with sharp ridges about them, making the\\r\\nforehead forbiddingly narrow; the upper lip, slightly lifted, shows the\\r\\nwhite teeth, rigidly clenched. The hair is heavy with moisture, the face\\r\\nas wet as the dewy grass all about. From his point of view the officer\\r\\ndoes not observe the rifle; the man was apparently killed by the fall of\\r\\nthe building.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Dead a week,\" said the officer curtly, moving on and absently pulling\\r\\nout his watch as if to verify his estimate of time. Six o\\'clock and\\r\\nforty minutes.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nKILLED AT RESACA\\r\\n\\r\\nThe best soldier of our staff was Lieutenant Herman Brayle, one of the\\r\\ntwo aides-de-camp. I don\\'t remember where the general picked him up;\\r\\nfrom some Ohio regiment, I think; none of us had previously known him,\\r\\nand it would have been strange if we had, for no two of us came from the\\r\\nsame State, nor even from adjoining States. The general seemed to think\\r\\nthat a position on his staff was a distinction that should be so\\r\\njudiciously conferred as not to beget any sectional jealousies and\\r\\nimperil the integrity of that part of the country which was still an\\r\\ninteger. He would not even choose officers from his own command, but by\\r\\nsome jugglery at department headquarters obtained them from other\\r\\nbrigades. Under such circumstances, a man\\'s services had to be very\\r\\ndistinguished indeed to be heard of by his family and the friends of his\\r\\nyouth; and \"the speaking trump of fame\" was a trifle hoarse from\\r\\nloquacity, anyhow.\\r\\n\\r\\nLieutenant Brayle was more than six feet in height and of splendid\\r\\nproportions, with the light hair and gray-blue eyes which men so gifted\\r\\nusually find associated with a high order of courage. As he was commonly\\r\\nin full uniform, especially in action, when most officers are content to\\r\\nbe less flamboyantly attired, he was a very striking and conspicuous\\r\\nfigure. As to the rest, he had a gentleman\\'s manners, a scholar\\'s head,\\r\\nand a lion\\'s heart. His age was about thirty.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe all soon came to like Brayle as much as we admired him, and it was\\r\\nwith sincere concern that in the engagement at Stone\\'s River--our first\\r\\naction after he joined us--we observed that he had one most\\r\\nobjectionable and unsoldierly quality: he was vain of his courage.\\r\\nDuring all the vicissitudes and mutations of that hideous encounter,\\r\\nwhether our troops were fighting in the open cotton fields, in the cedar\\r\\nthickets, or behind the railway embankment, he did not once take cover,\\r\\nexcept when sternly commanded to do so by the general, who usually had\\r\\nother things to think of than the lives of his staff officers--or those\\r\\nof his men, for that matter.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn every later engagement while Brayle was with us it was the same way.\\r\\nHe would sit his horse like an equestrian statue, in a storm of bullets\\r\\nand grape, in the most exposed places--wherever, in fact, duty,\\r\\nrequiring him to go, permitted him to remain--when, without trouble and\\r\\nwith distinct advantage to his reputation for common sense, he might\\r\\nhave been in such security as is possible on a battlefield in the brief\\r\\nintervals of personal inaction.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn foot, from necessity or in deference to his dismounted commander or\\r\\nassociates, his conduct was the same. He would stand like a rock in the\\r\\nopen when officers and men alike had taken to cover; while men older in\\r\\nservice and years, higher in rank and of unquestionable intrepidity,\\r\\nwere loyally preserving behind the crest of a hill lives infinitely\\r\\nprecious to their country, this fellow would stand, equally idle, on the\\r\\nridge, facing in the direction of the sharpest fire.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen battles are going on in open ground it frequently occurs that the\\r\\nopposing lines, confronting each other within a stone\\'s throw for hours,\\r\\nhug the earth as closely as if they loved it. The line officers in their\\r\\nproper places flatten themselves no less, and the field officers, their\\r\\nhorses all killed or sent to the rear, crouch beneath the infernal\\r\\ncanopy of hissing lead and screaming iron without a thought of personal\\r\\ndignity.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn such circumstances the life of a staff officer of a brigade is\\r\\ndistinctly \"not a happy one,\" mainly because of its precarious tenure\\r\\nand the unnerving alternations of emotion to which he is exposed. From a\\r\\nposition of that comparative security from which a civilian would\\r\\nascribe his escape to a \"miracle,\" he may be despatched with an order to\\r\\nsome commander of a prone regiment in the front line--a person for the\\r\\nmoment inconspicuous and not always easy to find without a deal of\\r\\nsearch among men somewhat preoccupied, and in a din in which question\\r\\nand answer alike must be imparted in the sign language. It is customary\\r\\nin such cases to duck the head and scuttle away on a keen run, an object\\r\\nof lively interest to some thousands of admiring marksmen. In returning\\r\\n--well, it is not customary to return.\\r\\n\\r\\nBrayle\\'s practice was different. He would consign his horse to the care\\r\\nof an orderly,--he loved his horse,--and walk quietly away on his\\r\\nperilous errand with never a stoop of the back, his splendid figure,\\r\\naccentuated by his uniform, holding the eye with a strange fascination.\\r\\nWe watched him with suspended breath, our hearts in our mouths. On one\\r\\noccasion of this kind, indeed, one of our number, an impetuous\\r\\nstammerer, was so possessed by his emotion that he shouted at me:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I\\'ll b-b-bet you t-two d-d-dollars they d-drop him b-b-before he g-gets\\r\\nto that d-d-ditch!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI did not accept the brutal wager; I thought they would.\\r\\n\\r\\nLet me do justice to a brave man\\'s memory; in all these needless\\r\\nexposures of life there was no visible bravado nor subsequent narration.\\r\\nIn the few instances when some of us had ventured to remonstrate, Brayle\\r\\nhad smiled pleasantly and made some light reply, which, however, had not\\r\\nencouraged a further pursuit of the subject. Once he said:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Captain, if ever I come to grief by forgetting your advice, I hope my\\r\\nlast moments will be cheered by the sound of your beloved voice\\r\\nbreathing into my ear the blessed words, \\'I told you so.\\'\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWe laughed at the captain--just why we could probably not have\\r\\nexplained--and that afternoon when he was shot to rags from an ambuscade\\r\\nBrayle remained by the body for some time, adjusting the limbs with\\r\\nneedless care--there in the middle of a road swept by gusts of grape and\\r\\ncanister! It is easy to condemn this kind of thing, and not very\\r\\ndifficult to refrain from imitation, but it is impossible not to\\r\\nrespect, and Brayle was liked none the less for the weakness which had\\r\\nso heroic an expression. We wished he were not a fool, but he went on\\r\\nthat way to the end, sometimes hard hit, but always returning to duty\\r\\nabout as good as new.\\r\\n\\r\\nOf course, it came at last; he who ignores the law of probabilities\\r\\nchallenges an adversary that is seldom beaten. It was at Resaca, in\\r\\nGeorgia, during the movement that resulted in the taking of Atlanta. In\\r\\nfront of our brigade the enemy\\'s line of earthworks ran through open\\r\\nfields along a slight crest. At each end of this open ground we were\\r\\nclose up to him in the woods, but the clear ground we could not hope to\\r\\noccupy until night, when darkness would enable us to burrow like moles\\r\\nand throw up earth. At this point our line was a quarter-mile away in\\r\\nthe edge of a wood. Roughly, we formed a semicircle, the enemy\\'s\\r\\nfortified line being the chord of the arc.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Lieutenant, go tell Colonel Ward to work up as close as he can get\\r\\ncover, and not to waste much ammunition in unnecessary firing. You may\\r\\nleave your horse.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the general gave this direction we were in the fringe of the\\r\\nforest, near the right extremity of the arc. Colonel Ward was at the\\r\\nleft. The suggestion to leave the horse obviously enough meant that\\r\\nBrayle was to take the longer line, through the woods and among the men.\\r\\nIndeed, the suggestion was needless; to go by the short route meant\\r\\nabsolutely certain failure to deliver the message. Before anybody could\\r\\ninterpose, Brayle had cantered lightly into the field and the enemy\\'s\\r\\nworks were in crackling conflagration.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Stop that damned fool!\" shouted the general.\\r\\n\\r\\nA private of the escort, with more ambition than brains, spurred forward\\r\\nto obey, and within ten yards left himself and his horse dead on the\\r\\nfield of honor.\\r\\n\\r\\nBrayle was beyond recall, galloping easily along, parallel to the enemy\\r\\nand less than two hundred yards distant. He was a picture to see! His\\r\\nhat had been blown or shot from his head, and his long, blond hair rose\\r\\nand fell with the motion of his horse. He sat erect in the saddle,\\r\\nholding the reins lightly in his left hand, his right hanging carelessly\\r\\nat his side. An occasional glimpse of his handsome profile as he turned\\r\\nhis head one way or the other proved that the interest which he took in\\r\\nwhat was going on was natural and without affectation.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe picture was intensely dramatic, but in no degree theatrical.\\r\\nSuccessive scores of rifles spat at him viciously as he came within\\r\\nrange, and our own line in the edge of the timber broke out in visible\\r\\nand audible defense. No longer regardful of themselves or their orders,\\r\\nour fellows sprang to their feet, and swarming into the open sent broad\\r\\nsheets of bullets against the blazing crest of the offending works,\\r\\nwhich poured an answering fire into their unprotected groups with deadly\\r\\neffect. The artillery on both sides joined the battle, punctuating the\\r\\nrattle and roar with deep, earth-shaking explosions and tearing the air\\r\\nwith storms of screaming grape, which from the enemy\\'s side splintered\\r\\nthe trees and spattered them with blood, and from ours defiled the smoke\\r\\nof his arms with banks and clouds of dust from his parapet.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy attention had been for a moment drawn to the general combat, but now,\\r\\nglancing down the unobscured avenue between these two thunderclouds, I\\r\\nsaw Brayle, the cause of the carnage. Invisible now from either side,\\r\\nand equally doomed by friend and foe, he stood in the shot-swept space,\\r\\nmotionless, his face toward the enemy. At some little distance lay his\\r\\nhorse. I instantly saw what had stopped him.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs topographical engineer I had, early in the day, made a hasty\\r\\nexamination of the ground, and now remembered that at that point was a\\r\\ndeep and sinuous gully, crossing half the field from the enemy\\'s line,\\r\\nits general course at right angles to it. From where we now were it was\\r\\ninvisible, and Brayle had evidently not known about it. Clearly, it was\\r\\nimpassable. Its salient angles would have afforded him absolute security\\r\\nif he had chosen to be satisfied with the miracle already wrought in his\\r\\nfavor and leapt into it. He could not go forward, he would not turn\\r\\nback; he stood awaiting death. It did not keep him long waiting.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy some mysterious coincidence, almost instantaneously as he fell, the\\r\\nfiring ceased, a few desultory shots at long intervals serving rather to\\r\\naccentuate than break the silence. It was as if both sides had suddenly\\r\\nrepented of their profitless crime. Four stretcher-bearers of ours,\\r\\nfollowing a sergeant with a white flag, soon afterward moved unmolested\\r\\ninto the field, and made straight for Brayle\\'s body. Several Confederate\\r\\nofficers and men came out to meet them, and with uncovered heads\\r\\nassisted them to take up their sacred burden. As it was borne toward us\\r\\nwe heard beyond the hostile works fifes and a muffled drum--a dirge. A\\r\\ngenerous enemy honored the fallen brave.\\r\\n\\r\\nAmongst the dead man\\'s effects was a soiled Russia-leather pocketbook.\\r\\nIn the distribution of mementoes of our friend, which the general, as\\r\\nadministrator, decreed, this fell to me.\\r\\n\\r\\nA year after the close of the war, on my way to California, I opened and\\r\\nidly inspected it. Out of an overlooked compartment fell a letter\\r\\nwithout envelope or address. It was in a woman\\'s handwriting, and began\\r\\nwith words of endearment, but no name.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt had the following date line: \"San Francisco, Cal., July 9, 1862.\" The\\r\\nsignature was \"Darling,\" in marks of quotation. Incidentally, in the\\r\\nbody of the text, the writer\\'s full name was given--Marian Mendenhall.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe letter showed evidence of cultivation and good breeding, but it was\\r\\nan ordinary love letter, if a love letter can be ordinary. There was not\\r\\nmuch in it, but there was something. It was this:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Mr. Winters, whom I shall always hate for it, has been telling that at\\r\\nsome battle in Virginia, where he got his hurt, you were seen crouching\\r\\nbehind a tree. I think he wants to injure you in my regard, which he\\r\\nknows the story would do if I believed it. I could bear to hear of my\\r\\nsoldier lover\\'s death, but not of his cowardice.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThese were the words which on that sunny afternoon, in a distant region,\\r\\nhad slain a hundred men. Is woman weak?\\r\\n\\r\\nOne evening I called on Miss Mendenhall to return the letter to her. I\\r\\nintended, also, to tell her what she had done--but not that she did it.\\r\\nI found her in a handsome dwelling on Rincon Hill. She was beautiful,\\r\\nwell bred--in a word, charming.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You knew Lieutenant Herman Brayle,\" I said, rather abruptly. \"You know,\\r\\ndoubtless, that he fell in battle. Among his effects was found this\\r\\nletter from you. My errand here is to place it in your hands.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe mechanically took the letter, glanced through it with deepening\\r\\ncolor, and then, looking at me with a smile, said:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is very good of you, though I am sure it was hardly worth while.\"\\r\\nShe started suddenly and changed color. \"This stain,\" she said, \"is it--\\r\\nsurely it is not--\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Madam,\" I said, \"pardon me, but that is the blood of the truest and\\r\\nbravest heart that ever beat.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe hastily flung the letter on the blazing coals. \"Uh! I cannot bear\\r\\nthe sight of blood!\" she said. \"How did he die?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI had involuntarily risen to rescue that scrap of paper, sacred even to\\r\\nme, and now stood partly behind her. As she asked the question she\\r\\nturned her face about and slightly upward. The light of the burning\\r\\nletter was reflected in her eyes and touched her cheek with a tinge of\\r\\ncrimson like the stain upon its page. I had never seen anything so\\r\\nbeautiful as this detestable creature.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He was bitten by a snake,\" I replied.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE AFFAIR AT COULTER\\'S NOTCH\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Do you think, Colonel, that your brave Coulter would like to put one of\\r\\nhis guns in here?\" the general asked.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was apparently not altogether serious; it certainly did not seem a\\r\\nplace where any artillerist, however brave, would like to put a gun. The\\r\\ncolonel thought that possibly his division commander meant\\r\\ngood-humoredly to intimate that in a recent conversation between them\\r\\nCaptain Coulter\\'s courage had been too highly extolled.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"General,\" he replied warmly, \"Coulter would like to put a gun anywhere\\r\\nwithin reach of those people,\" with a motion of his hand in the\\r\\ndirection of the enemy.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is the only place,\" said the general. He was serious, then.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe place was a depression, a \"notch,\" in the sharp crest of a hill. It\\r\\nwas a pass, and through it ran a turnpike, which reaching this highest\\r\\npoint in its course by a sinuous ascent through a thin forest made a\\r\\nsimilar, though less steep, descent toward the enemy. For a mile to the\\r\\nleft and a mile to the right, the ridge, though occupied by Federal\\r\\ninfantry lying close behind the sharp crest and appearing as if held in\\r\\nplace by atmospheric pressure, was inaccessible to artillery. There was\\r\\nno place but the bottom of the notch, and that was barely wide enough\\r\\nfor the roadbed. From the Confederate side this point was commanded by\\r\\ntwo batteries posted on a slightly lower elevation beyond a creek, and a\\r\\nhalf-mile away. All the guns but one were masked by the trees of an\\r\\norchard; that one--it seemed a bit of impudence--was on an open lawn\\r\\ndirectly in front of a rather grandiose building, the planter\\'s\\r\\ndwelling. The gun was safe enough in its exposure--but only because the\\r\\nFederal infantry had been forbidden to fire. Coulter\\'s Notch--it came to\\r\\nbe called so--was not, that pleasant summer afternoon, a place where one\\r\\nwould \"like to put a gun.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThree or four dead horses lay there sprawling in the road, three or four\\r\\ndead men in a trim row at one side of it, and a little back, down the\\r\\nhill. All but one were cavalrymen belonging to the Federal advance. One\\r\\nwas a quartermaster. The general commanding the division and the colonel\\r\\ncommanding the brigade, with their staffs and escorts, had ridden into\\r\\nthe notch to have a look at the enemy\\'s guns--which had straightway\\r\\nobscured themselves in towering clouds of smoke. It was hardly\\r\\nprofitable to be curious about guns which had the trick of the\\r\\ncuttle-fish, and the season of observation had been brief. At its\\r\\nconclusion--a short remove backward from where it began--occurred the\\r\\nconversation already partly reported. \"It is the only place,\" the\\r\\ngeneral repeated thoughtfully, \"to get at them.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe colonel looked at him gravely. \"There is room for only one gun,\\r\\nGeneral--one against twelve.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That is true--for only one at a time,\" said the commander with\\r\\nsomething like, yet not altogether like, a smile. \"But then, your brave\\r\\nCoulter--a whole battery in himself.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe tone of irony was now unmistakable. It angered the colonel, but he\\r\\ndid not know what to say. The spirit of military subordination is not\\r\\nfavorable to retort, nor even to deprecation.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt this moment a young officer of artillery came riding slowly up the\\r\\nroad attended by his bugler. It was Captain Coulter. He could not have\\r\\nbeen more than twenty-three years of age. He was of medium height, but\\r\\nvery slender and lithe, and sat his horse with something of the air of a\\r\\ncivilian. In face he was of a type singularly unlike the men about him;\\r\\nthin, high-nosed, gray-eyed, with a slight blond mustache, and long,\\r\\nrather straggling hair of the same color. There was an apparent\\r\\nnegligence in his attire. His cap was worn with the visor a trifle\\r\\naskew; his coat was buttoned only at the sword-belt, showing a\\r\\nconsiderable expanse of white shirt, tolerably clean for that stage of\\r\\nthe campaign. But the negligence was all in his dress and bearing; in\\r\\nhis face was a look of intense interest in his surroundings. His gray\\r\\neyes, which seemed occasionally to strike right and left across the\\r\\nlandscape, like search-lights, were for the most part fixed upon the sky\\r\\nbeyond the Notch; until he should arrive at the summit of the road there\\r\\nwas nothing else in that direction to see. As he came opposite his\\r\\ndivision and brigade commanders at the road-side he saluted mechanically\\r\\nand was about to pass on. The colonel signed to him to halt.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Captain Coulter,\" he said, \"the enemy has twelve pieces over there on\\r\\nthe next ridge. If I rightly understand the general, he directs that you\\r\\nbring up a gun and engage them.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was a blank silence; the general looked stolidly at a distant\\r\\nregiment swarming slowly up the hill through rough undergrowth, like a\\r\\ntorn and draggled cloud of blue smoke; the captain appeared not to have\\r\\nobserved him. Presently the captain spoke, slowly and with apparent\\r\\neffort:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"On the next ridge, did you say, sir? Are the guns near the house?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ah, you have been over this road before. Directly at the house.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And it is--necessary--to engage them? The order is imperative?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHis voice was husky and broken. He was visibly paler. The colonel was\\r\\nastonished and mortified. He stole a glance at the commander. In that\\r\\nset, immobile face was no sign; it was as hard as bronze. A moment later\\r\\nthe general rode away, followed by his staff and escort. The colonel,\\r\\nhumiliated and indignant, was about to order Captain Coulter in arrest,\\r\\nwhen the latter spoke a few words in a low tone to his bugler, saluted,\\r\\nand rode straight forward into the Notch, where, presently, at the\\r\\nsummit of the road, his field-glass at his eyes, he showed against the\\r\\nsky, he and his horse, sharply defined and statuesque. The bugler had\\r\\ndashed down the speed and disappeared behind a wood. Presently his bugle\\r\\nwas heard singing in the cedars, and in an incredibly short time a\\r\\nsingle gun with its caisson, each drawn by six horses and manned by its\\r\\nfull complement of gunners, came bounding and banging up the grade in a\\r\\nstorm of dust, unlimbered under cover, and was run forward by hand to\\r\\nthe fatal crest among the dead horses. A gesture of the captain\\'s arm,\\r\\nsome strangely agile movements of the men in loading, and almost before\\r\\nthe troops along the way had ceased to hear the rattle of the wheels, a\\r\\ngreat white cloud sprang forward down the slope, and with a deafening\\r\\nreport the affair at Coulter\\'s Notch had begun.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is not intended to relate in detail the progress and incidents of\\r\\nthat ghastly contest--a contest without vicissitudes, its alternations\\r\\nonly different degrees of despair. Almost at the instant when Captain\\r\\nCoulter\\'s gun blew its challenging cloud twelve answering clouds rolled\\r\\nupward from among the trees about the plantation house, a deep multiple\\r\\nreport roared back like a broken echo, and thenceforth to the end the\\r\\nFederal cannoneers fought their hopeless battle in an atmosphere of\\r\\nliving iron whose thoughts were lightnings and whose deeds were death.\\r\\n\\r\\nUnwilling to see the efforts which he could not aid and the slaughter\\r\\nwhich he could not stay, the colonel ascended the ridge at a point a\\r\\nquarter of a mile to the left, whence the Notch, itself invisible, but\\r\\npushing up successive masses of smoke, seemed the crater of a volcano in\\r\\nthundering eruption. With his glass he watched the enemy\\'s guns, noting\\r\\nas he could the effects of Coulter\\'s fire--if Coulter still lived to\\r\\ndirect it. He saw that the Federal gunners, ignoring those of the\\r\\nenemy\\'s pieces whose positions could be determined by their smoke only,\\r\\ngave their whole attention to the one that maintained its place in the\\r\\nopen--the lawn in front of the house. Over and about that hardy piece\\r\\nthe shells exploded at intervals of a few seconds. Some exploded in the\\r\\nhouse, as could be seen by thin ascensions of smoke from the breached\\r\\nroof. Figures of prostrate men and horses were plainly visible.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If our fellows are doing so good work with a single gun,\" said the\\r\\ncolonel to an aide who happened to be nearest, \"they must be suffering\\r\\nlike the devil from twelve. Go down and present the commander of that\\r\\npiece with my congratulations on the accuracy of his fire.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nTurning to his adjutant-general he said, \"Did you observe Coulter\\'s\\r\\ndamned reluctance to obey orders?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, sir, I did.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, say nothing about it, please. I don\\'t think the general will care\\r\\nto make any accusations. He will probably have enough to do in\\r\\nexplaining his own connection with this uncommon way of amusing the\\r\\nrear-guard of a retreating enemy.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nA young officer approached from below, climbing breathless up the\\r\\nacclivity. Almost before he had saluted, he gasped out:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Colonel, I am directed by Colonel Harmon to say that the enemy\\'s guns\\r\\nare within easy reach of our rifles, and most of them visible from\\r\\nseveral points along the ridge.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe brigade commander looked at him without a trace of interest in his\\r\\nexpression. \"I know it,\" he said quietly.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe young adjutant was visibly embarrassed. \"Colonel Harmon would like\\r\\nto have permission to silence those guns,\" he stammered.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"So should I,\" the colonel said in the same tone. \"Present my\\r\\ncompliments to Colonel Harmon and say to him that the general\\'s orders\\r\\nfor the infantry not to fire are still in force.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe adjutant saluted and retired. The colonel ground his heel into the\\r\\nearth and turned to look again at the enemy\\'s guns.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Colonel,\" said the adjutant-general, \"I don\\'t know that I ought to say\\r\\nanything, but there is something wrong in all this. Do you happen to\\r\\nknow that Captain Coulter is from the South?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No; _was_ he, indeed?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I heard that last summer the division which the general then commanded\\r\\nwas in the vicinity of Coulter\\'s home--camped there for weeks, and--\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Listen!\" said the colonel, interrupting with an upward gesture. \"Do you\\r\\nhear _that_?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That\" was the silence of the Federal gun. The staff, the orderlies, the\\r\\nlines of infantry behind the crest--all had \"heard,\" and were looking\\r\\ncuriously in the direction of the crater, whence no smoke now ascended\\r\\nexcept desultory cloudlets from the enemy\\'s shells. Then came the blare\\r\\nof a bugle, a faint rattle of wheels; a minute later the sharp reports\\r\\nrecommenced with double activity. The demolished gun had been replaced\\r\\nwith a sound one.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes,\" said the adjutant-general, resuming his narrative, \"the general\\r\\nmade the acquaintance of Coulter\\'s family. There was trouble--I don\\'t\\r\\nknow the exact nature of it--something about Coulter\\'s wife. She is a\\r\\nred-hot Secessionist, as they all are, except Coulter himself, but she\\r\\nis a good wife and high-bred lady. There was a complaint to army\\r\\nheadquarters. The general was transferred to this division. It is odd\\r\\nthat Coulter\\'s battery should afterward have been assigned to it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe colonel had risen from the rock upon which they had been sitting.\\r\\nHis eyes were blazing with a generous indignation.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"See here, Morrison,\" said he, looking his gossiping staff officer\\r\\nstraight in the face, \"did you get that story from a gentleman or a\\r\\nliar?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I don\\'t want to say how I got it, Colonel, unless it is necessary\"--he\\r\\nwas blushing a trifle--\"but I\\'ll stake my life upon its truth in the\\r\\nmain.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe colonel turned toward a small knot of officers some distance away.\\r\\n\"Lieutenant Williams!\" he shouted.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne of the officers detached himself from the group and coming forward\\r\\nsaluted, saying: \"Pardon me, Colonel, I thought you had been informed.\\r\\nWilliams is dead down there by the gun. What can I do, sir?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nLieutenant Williams was the aide who had had the pleasure of conveying\\r\\nto the officer in charge of the gun his brigade commander\\'s\\r\\ncongratulations.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Go,\" said the colonel, \"and direct the withdrawal of that gun\\r\\ninstantly. No--I\\'ll go myself.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe strode down the declivity toward the rear of the Notch at a\\r\\nbreak-neck pace, over rocks and through brambles, followed by his little\\r\\nretinue in tumultuous disorder. At the foot of the declivity they\\r\\nmounted their waiting animals and took to the road at a lively trot,\\r\\nround a bend and into the Notch. The spectacle which they encountered\\r\\nthere was appalling!\\r\\n\\r\\nWithin that defile, barely broad enough for a single gun, were piled the\\r\\nwrecks of no fewer than four. They had noted the silencing of only the\\r\\nlast one disabled--there had been a lack of men to replace it quickly\\r\\nwith another. The d\\xc3\\xa9bris lay on both sides of the road; the men had\\r\\nmanaged to keep an open way between, through which the fifth piece was\\r\\nnow firing. The men?--they looked like demons of the pit! All were\\r\\nhatless, all stripped to the waist, their reeking skins black with\\r\\nblotches of powder and spattered with gouts of blood. They worked like\\r\\nmadmen, with rammer and cartridge, lever and lanyard. They set their\\r\\nswollen shoulders and bleeding hands against the wheels at each recoil\\r\\nand heaved the heavy gun back to its place. There were no commands; in\\r\\nthat awful environment of whooping shot, exploding shells, shrieking\\r\\nfragments of iron, and flying splinters of wood, none could have been\\r\\nheard. Officers, if officers there were, were indistinguishable; all\\r\\nworked together--each while he lasted--governed by the eye. When the gun\\r\\nwas sponged, it was loaded; when loaded, aimed and fired. The colonel\\r\\nobserved something new to his military experience--something horrible\\r\\nand unnatural: the gun was bleeding at the mouth! In temporary default\\r\\nof water, the man sponging had dipped his sponge into a pool of\\r\\ncomrade\\'s blood. In all this work there was no clashing; the duty of the\\r\\ninstant was obvious. When one fell, another, looking a trifle cleaner,\\r\\nseemed to rise from the earth in the dead man\\'s tracks, to fall in his\\r\\nturn.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith the ruined guns lay the ruined men--alongside the wreckage, under\\r\\nit and atop of it; and back down the road--a ghastly procession!--crept\\r\\non hands and knees such of the wounded as were able to move. The\\r\\ncolonel--he had compassionately sent his cavalcade to the right about--\\r\\nhad to ride over those who were entirely dead in order not to crush\\r\\nthose who were partly alive. Into that hell he tranquilly held his way,\\r\\nrode up alongside the gun, and, in the obscurity of the last discharge,\\r\\ntapped upon the cheek the man holding the rammer--who straightway fell,\\r\\nthinking himself killed. A fiend seven times damned sprang out of the\\r\\nsmoke to take his place, but paused and gazed up at the mounted officer\\r\\nwith an unearthly regard, his teeth flashing between his black lips, his\\r\\neyes, fierce and expanded, burning like coals beneath his bloody brow.\\r\\nThe colonel made an authoritative gesture and pointed to the rear. The\\r\\nfiend bowed in token of obedience. It was Captain Coulter.\\r\\n\\r\\nSimultaneously with the colonel\\'s arresting sign, silence fell upon the\\r\\nwhole field of action. The procession of missiles no longer streamed\\r\\ninto that defile of death, for the enemy also had ceased firing. His\\r\\narmy had been gone for hours, and the commander of his rear-guard, who\\r\\nhad held his position perilously long in hope to silence the Federal\\r\\nfire, at that strange moment had silenced his own. \"I was not aware of\\r\\nthe breadth of my authority,\" said the colonel to anybody, riding\\r\\nforward to the crest to see what had really happened. An hour later his\\r\\nbrigade was in bivouac on the enemy\\'s ground, and its idlers were\\r\\nexamining, with something of awe, as the faithful inspect a saint\\'s\\r\\nrelics, a score of straddling dead horses and three disabled guns, all\\r\\nspiked. The fallen men had been carried away; their torn and broken\\r\\nbodies would have given too great satisfaction.\\r\\n\\r\\nNaturally, the colonel established himself and his military family in\\r\\nthe plantation house. It was somewhat shattered, but it was better than\\r\\nthe open air. The furniture was greatly deranged and broken. Walls and\\r\\nceilings were knocked away here and there, and a lingering odor of\\r\\npowder smoke was everywhere. The beds, the closets of women\\'s clothing,\\r\\nthe cupboards were not greatly dam-aged. The new tenants for a night\\r\\nmade themselves comfortable, and the virtual effacement of Coulter\\'s\\r\\nbattery supplied them with an interesting topic.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring supper an orderly of the escort showed himself into the\\r\\ndining-room and asked permission to speak to the colonel.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What is it, Barbour?\" said that officer pleasantly, having overheard\\r\\nthe request.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Colonel, there is something wrong in the cellar; I don\\'t know what--\\r\\nsomebody there. I was down there rummaging about.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I will go down and see,\" said a staff officer, rising.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"So will I,\" the colonel said; \"let the others remain. Lead on,\\r\\norderly.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThey took a candle from the table and descended the cellar stairs, the\\r\\norderly in visible trepidation. The candle made but a feeble light, but\\r\\npresently, as they advanced, its narrow circle of illumination revealed\\r\\na human figure seated on the ground against the black stone wall which\\r\\nthey were skirting, its knees elevated, its head bowed sharply forward.\\r\\nThe face, which should have been seen in profile, was invisible, for the\\r\\nman was bent so far forward that his long hair concealed it; and,\\r\\nstrange to relate, the beard, of a much darker hue, fell in a great\\r\\ntangled mass and lay along the ground at his side. They involuntarily\\r\\npaused; then the colonel, taking the candle from the orderly\\'s shaking\\r\\nhand, approached the man and attentively considered him. The long dark\\r\\nbeard was the hair of a woman--dead. The dead woman clasped in her arms\\r\\na dead babe. Both were clasped in the arms of the man, pressed against\\r\\nhis breast, against his lips. There was blood in the hair of the woman;\\r\\nthere was blood in the hair of the man. A yard away, near an irregular\\r\\ndepression in the beaten earth which formed the cellar\\'s floor--fresh\\r\\nexcavation with a convex bit of iron, having jagged edges, visible in\\r\\none of the sides--lay an infant\\'s foot. The colonel held the light as\\r\\nhigh as he could. The floor of the room above was broken through, the\\r\\nsplinters pointing at all angles downward. \"This casemate is not\\r\\nbomb-proof,\" said the colonel gravely. It did not occur to him that his\\r\\nsumming up of the matter had any levity in it.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey stood about the group awhile in silence; the staff officer was\\r\\nthinking of his unfinished supper, the orderly of what might possibly be\\r\\nin one of the casks on the other side of the cellar. Suddenly the man\\r\\nwhom they had thought dead raised his head and gazed tranquilly into\\r\\ntheir faces. His complexion was coal black; the cheeks were apparently\\r\\ntattooed in irregular sinuous lines from the eyes downward. The lips,\\r\\ntoo, were white, like those of a stage negro. There was blood upon his\\r\\nforehead.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe staff officer drew back a pace, the orderly two paces.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What are you doing here, my man?\" said the colonel, unmoved.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"This house belongs to me, sir,\" was the reply, civilly delivered.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"To you? Ah, I see! And these?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My wife and child. I am Captain Coulter.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE COUP DE GR\\xc3\\x82CE\\r\\n\\r\\nThe fighting had been hard and continuous; that was attested by all the\\r\\nsenses. The very taste of battle was in the air. All was now over; it\\r\\nremained only to succor the wounded and bury the dead--to \"tidy up a\\r\\nbit,\" as the humorist of a burial squad put it. A good deal of \"tidying\\r\\nup\" was required. As far as one could see through the forests, among the\\r\\nsplintered trees, lay wrecks of men and horses. Among them moved the\\r\\nstretcher-bearers, gathering and carrying away the few who showed signs\\r\\nof life. Most of the wounded had died of neglect while the right to\\r\\nminister to their wants was in dispute. It is an army regulation that\\r\\nthe wounded must wait; the best way to care for them is to win the\\r\\nbattle. It must be confessed that victory is a distinct advantage to a\\r\\nman requiring attention, but many do not live to avail themselves of it.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe dead were collected in groups of a dozen or a score and laid side by\\r\\nside in rows while the trenches were dug to receive them.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome, found at too great a distance from these rallying points, were\\r\\nburied where they lay. There was little attempt at identification,\\r\\nthough in most cases, the burial parties being detailed to glean the\\r\\nsame ground which they had assisted to reap, the names of the victorious\\r\\ndead were known and listed. The enemy\\'s fallen had to be content with\\r\\ncounting. But of that they got enough: many of them were counted several\\r\\ntimes, and the total, as given afterward in the official report of the\\r\\nvictorious commander, denoted rather a hope than a result.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt some little distance from the spot where one of the burial parties\\r\\nhad established its \"bivouac of the dead,\" a man in the uniform of a\\r\\nFederal officer stood leaning against a tree. From his feet upward to\\r\\nhis neck his attitude was that of weariness reposing; but he turned his\\r\\nhead uneasily from side to side; his mind was apparently not at rest. He\\r\\nwas perhaps uncertain in which direction to go; he was not likely to\\r\\nremain long where he was, for already the level rays of the setting sun\\r\\nstraggled redly through the open spaces of the wood and the weary\\r\\nsoldiers were quitting their task for the day. He would hardly make a\\r\\nnight of it alone there among the dead.\\r\\n\\r\\nNine men in ten whom you meet after a battle inquire the way to some\\r\\nfraction of the army--as if any one could know. Doubtless this officer\\r\\nwas lost. After resting himself a moment he would presumably follow one\\r\\nof the retiring burial squads.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen all were gone he walked straight away into the forest toward the\\r\\nred west, its light staining his face like blood. The air of confidence\\r\\nwith which he now strode along showed that he was on familiar ground; he\\r\\nhad recovered his bearings. The dead on his right and on his left were\\r\\nunregarded as he passed. An occasional low moan from some\\r\\nsorely-stricken wretch whom the relief-parties had not reached, and who\\r\\nwould have to pass a comfortless night beneath the stars with his thirst\\r\\nto keep him company, was equally unheeded. What, indeed, could the\\r\\nofficer have done, being no surgeon and having no water?\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the head of a shallow ravine, a mere depression of the ground, lay a\\r\\nsmall group of bodies. He saw, and swerving suddenly from his course\\r\\nwalked rapidly toward them. Scanning each one sharply as he passed, he\\r\\nstopped at last above one which lay at a slight remove from the others,\\r\\nnear a clump of small trees. He looked at it narrowly. It seemed to\\r\\nstir. He stooped and laid his hand upon its face. It screamed.\\r\\n\\r\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\r\\n\\r\\nThe officer was Captain Downing Madwell, of a Massachusetts regiment of\\r\\ninfantry, a daring and intelligent soldier, an honorable man.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the regiment were two brothers named Halcrow--Caffal and Creede\\r\\nHalcrow. Caffal Halcrow was a sergeant in Captain Madwell\\'s company, and\\r\\nthese two men, the sergeant and the captain, were devoted friends. In so\\r\\nfar as disparity of rank, difference in duties and considerations of\\r\\nmilitary discipline would permit they were commonly together. They had,\\r\\nindeed, grown up together from childhood. A habit of the heart is not\\r\\neasily broken off. Caffal Halcrow had nothing military in his taste nor\\r\\ndisposition, but the thought of separation from his friend was\\r\\ndisagreeable; he enlisted in the company in which Madwell was\\r\\nsecond-lieutenant. Each had taken two steps upward in rank, but between\\r\\nthe highest non-commissioned and the lowest commissioned officer the\\r\\ngulf is deep and wide and the old relation was maintained with\\r\\ndifficulty and a difference.\\r\\n\\r\\nCreede Halcrow, the brother of Caffal, was the major of the regiment--a\\r\\ncynical, saturnine man, between whom and Captain Madwell there was a\\r\\nnatural antipathy which circumstances had nourished and strengthened to\\r\\nan active animosity. But for the restraining influence of their mutual\\r\\nrelation to Caffal these two patriots would doubtless have endeavored to\\r\\ndeprive their country of each other\\'s services.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the opening of the battle that morning the regiment was performing\\r\\noutpost duty a mile away from the main army. It was attacked and nearly\\r\\nsurrounded in the forest, but stubbornly held its ground. During a lull\\r\\nin the fighting, Major Halcrow came to Captain Madwell. The two\\r\\nexchanged formal salutes, and the major said: \"Captain, the colonel\\r\\ndirects that you push your company to the head of this ravine and hold\\r\\nyour place there until recalled. I need hardly apprise you of the\\r\\ndangerous character of the movement, but if you wish, you can, I\\r\\nsuppose, turn over the command to your first-lieutenant. I was not,\\r\\nhowever, directed to authorize the substitution; it is merely a\\r\\nsuggestion of my own, unofficially made.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nTo this deadly insult Captain Madwell coolly replied:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Sir, I invite you to accompany the movement. A mounted officer would be\\r\\na conspicuous mark, and I have long held the opinion that it would be\\r\\nbetter if you were dead.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe art of repartee was cultivated in military circles as early as 1862.\\r\\n\\r\\nA half-hour later Captain Madwell\\'s company was driven from its position\\r\\nat the head of the ravine, with a loss of one-third its number. Among\\r\\nthe fallen was Sergeant Halcrow. The regiment was soon afterward forced\\r\\nback to the main line, and at the close of the battle was miles away.\\r\\nThe captain was now standing at the side of his subordinate and friend.\\r\\n\\r\\nSergeant Halcrow was mortally hurt. His clothing was deranged; it seemed\\r\\nto have been violently torn apart, exposing the abdomen. Some of the\\r\\nbuttons of his jacket had been pulled off and lay on the ground beside\\r\\nhim and fragments of his other garments were strewn about. His leather\\r\\nbelt was parted and had apparently been dragged from beneath him as he\\r\\nlay. There had been no great effusion of blood. The only visible wound\\r\\nwas a wide, ragged opening in the abdomen.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was defiled with earth and dead leaves. Protruding from it was a loop\\r\\nof small intestine. In all his experience Captain Madwell had not seen a\\r\\nwound like this. He could neither conjecture how it was made nor explain\\r\\nthe attendant circumstances--the strangely torn clothing, the parted\\r\\nbelt, the besmirching of the white skin. He knelt and made a closer\\r\\nexamination. When he rose to his feet, he turned his eyes in different\\r\\ndirections as if looking for an enemy. Fifty yards away, on the crest of\\r\\na low, thinly wooded hill, he saw several dark objects moving about\\r\\namong the fallen men--a herd of swine. One stood with its back to him,\\r\\nits shoulders sharply elevated. Its forefeet were upon a human body, its\\r\\nhead was depressed and invisible. The bristly ridge of its chine showed\\r\\nblack against the red west. Captain Madwell drew away his eyes and fixed\\r\\nthem again upon the thing which had been his friend.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe man who had suffered these monstrous mutilations was alive. At\\r\\nintervals he moved his limbs; he moaned at every breath. He stared\\r\\nblankly into the face of his friend and if touched screamed. In his\\r\\ngiant agony he had torn up the ground on which he lay; his clenched\\r\\nhands were full of leaves and twigs and earth. Articulate speech was\\r\\nbeyond his power; it was impossible to know if he were sensible to\\r\\nanything but pain. The expression of his face was an appeal; his eyes\\r\\nwere full of prayer. For what?\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was no misreading that look; the captain had too frequently seen\\r\\nit in eyes of those whose lips had still the power to formulate it by an\\r\\nentreaty for death. Consciously or unconsciously, this writhing fragment\\r\\nof humanity, this type and example of acute sensation, this handiwork of\\r\\nman and beast, this humble, unheroic Prometheus, was imploring\\r\\neverything, all, the whole non-ego, for the boon of oblivion. To the\\r\\nearth and the sky alike, to the trees, to the man, to whatever took form\\r\\nin sense or consciousness, this incarnate suffering addressed that\\r\\nsilent plea.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor what, indeed? For that which we accord to even the meanest creature\\r\\nwithout sense to demand it, denying it only to the wretched of our own\\r\\nrace: for the blessed release, the rite of uttermost compassion, the\\r\\n_coup de gr\\xc3\\xa2ce_.\\r\\n\\r\\nCaptain Madwell spoke the name of his friend. He repeated it over and\\r\\nover without effect until emotion choked his utterance.\\r\\n\\r\\nHis tears plashed upon the livid face beneath his own and blinded\\r\\nhimself. He saw nothing but a blurred and moving object, but the moans\\r\\nwere more distinct than ever, interrupted at briefer intervals by\\r\\nsharper shrieks. He turned away, struck his hand upon his forehead, and\\r\\nstrode from the spot. The swine, catching sight of him, threw up their\\r\\ncrimson muzzles, regarding him suspiciously a second, and then with a\\r\\ngruff, concerted grunt, raced away out of sight. A horse, its foreleg\\r\\nsplintered by a cannon-shot, lifted its head sidewise from the ground\\r\\nand neighed piteously. Madwell stepped forward, drew his revolver and\\r\\nshot the poor beast between the eyes, narrowly observing its\\r\\ndeath-struggle, which, contrary to his expectation, was violent and\\r\\nlong; but at last it lay still. The tense muscles of its lips, which had\\r\\nuncovered the teeth in a horrible grin, relaxed; the sharp, clean-cut\\r\\nprofile took on a look of profound peace and rest.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlong the distant, thinly wooded crest to westward the fringe of sunset\\r\\nfire had now nearly burned itself out. The light upon the trunks of the\\r\\ntrees had faded to a tender gray; shadows were in their tops, like great\\r\\ndark birds aperch. Night was coming and there were miles of haunted\\r\\nforest between Captain Madwell and camp. Yet he stood there at the side\\r\\nof the dead animal, apparently lost to all sense of his surroundings.\\r\\nHis eyes were bent upon the earth at his feet; his left hand hung\\r\\nloosely at his side, his right still held the pistol. Presently he\\r\\nlifted his face, turned it toward his dying friend and walked rapidly\\r\\nback to his side. He knelt upon one knee, cocked the weapon, placed the\\r\\nmuzzle against the man\\'s forehead, and turning away his eyes pulled the\\r\\ntrigger. There was no report. He had used his last cartridge for the\\r\\nhorse.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe sufferer moaned and his lips moved convulsively. The froth that ran\\r\\nfrom them had a tinge of blood.\\r\\n\\r\\nCaptain Madwell rose to his feet and drew his sword from the scabbard.\\r\\nHe passed the fingers of his left hand along the edge from hilt to\\r\\npoint. He held it out straight before him, as if to test his nerves.\\r\\nThere was no visible tremor of the blade; the ray of bleak skylight that\\r\\nit reflected was steady and true. He stooped and with his left hand tore\\r\\naway the dying man\\'s shirt, rose and placed the point of the sword just\\r\\nover the heart. This time he did not withdraw his eyes. Grasping the\\r\\nhilt with both hands, he thrust downward with all his strength and\\r\\nweight. The blade sank into the man\\'s body--through his body into the\\r\\nearth; Captain Madwell came near falling forward upon his work. The\\r\\ndying man drew up his knees and at the same time threw his right arm\\r\\nacross his breast and grasped the steel so tightly that the knuckles of\\r\\nthe hand visibly whitened. By a violent but vain effort to withdraw the\\r\\nblade the wound was enlarged; a rill of blood escaped, running sinuously\\r\\ndown into the deranged clothing. At that moment three men stepped\\r\\nsilently forward from behind the clump of young trees which had\\r\\nconcealed their approach. Two were hospital attendants and carried a\\r\\nstretcher.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe third was Major Creede Halcrow.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPARKER ADDERSON, PHILOSOPHER\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Prisoner, what is your name?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"As I am to lose it at daylight to-morrow morning it is hardly worth\\r\\nwhile concealing it. Parker Adderson.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Your rank?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"A somewhat humble one; commissioned officers are too precious to be\\r\\nrisked in the perilous business of a spy. I am a sergeant.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Of what regiment?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You must excuse me; my answer might, for anything I know, give you an\\r\\nidea of whose forces are in your front. Such knowledge as that is what I\\r\\ncame into your lines to obtain, not to impart.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You are not without wit.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If you have the patience to wait you will find me dull enough\\r\\nto-morrow.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How do you know that you are to die to-morrow morning?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Among spies captured by night that is the custom. It is one of the nice\\r\\nobservances of the profession.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe general so far laid aside the dignity appropriate to a Confederate\\r\\nofficer of high rank and wide renown as to smile. But no one in his\\r\\npower and out of his favor would have drawn any happy augury from that\\r\\noutward and visible sign of approval. It was neither genial nor\\r\\ninfectious; it did not communicate itself to the other persons exposed\\r\\nto it--the caught spy who had provoked it and the armed guard who had\\r\\nbrought him into the tent and now stood a little apart, watching his\\r\\nprisoner in the yellow candle-light. It was no part of that warrior\\'s\\r\\nduty to smile; he had been detailed for another purpose. The\\r\\nconversation was resumed; it was in character a trial for a capital\\r\\noffense.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You admit, then, that you are a spy--that you came into my camp,\\r\\ndisguised as you are in the uniform of a Confederate soldier, to obtain\\r\\ninformation secretly regarding the numbers and disposition of my\\r\\ntroops.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Regarding, particularly, their numbers. Their disposition I already\\r\\nknew. It is morose.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe general brightened again; the guard, with a severer sense of his\\r\\nresponsibility, accentuated the austerity of his expression an stood a\\r\\ntrifle more erect than before. Twirling his gray slouch hat round and\\r\\nround upon his forefinger, the spy took a leisurely survey of his\\r\\nsurroundings. They were simple enough. The tent was a common \"wall\\r\\ntent,\" about eight feet by ten in dimensions, lighted by a single tallow\\r\\ncandle stuck into the haft of a bayonet, which was itself stuck into a\\r\\npine table at which the general sat, now busily writing and apparently\\r\\nforgetful of his unwilling guest. An old rag carpet covered the earthen\\r\\nfloor; an older leather trunk, a second chair and a roll of blankets\\r\\nwere about all else that the tent contained; in General Clavering\\'s\\r\\ncommand Confederate simplicity and penury of \"pomp and circumstance\" had\\r\\nattained their highest development. On a large nail driven into the tent\\r\\npole at the entrance was suspended a sword-belt supporting a long sabre,\\r\\na pistol in its holster and, absurdly enough, a bowie-knife. Of that\\r\\nmost unmilitary weapon it was the general\\'s habit to explain that it was\\r\\na souvenir of the peaceful days when he was a civilian.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was a stormy night. The rain cascaded upon the canvas in torrents,\\r\\nwith the dull, drum-like sound familiar to dwellers in tents. As the\\r\\nwhooping blasts charged upon it the frail structure shook and swayed and\\r\\nstrained at its confining stakes and ropes.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe general finished writing, folded the half-sheet of paper and spoke\\r\\nto the soldier guarding Adderson: \"Here, Tassman, take that to the\\r\\nadjutant-general; then return.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And the prisoner, General?\" said the soldier, saluting, with an\\r\\ninquiring glance in the direction of that unfortunate.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Do as I said,\" replied the officer, curtly.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe soldier took the note and ducked himself out of the tent. General\\r\\nClavering turned his handsome face toward the Federal spy, looked him in\\r\\nthe eyes, not unkindly, and said: \"It is a bad night, my man.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"For me, yes.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Do you guess what I have written?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Something worth reading, I dare say. And--perhaps it is my vanity--I\\r\\nventure to suppose that I am mentioned in it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes; it is a memorandum for an order to be read to the troops at\\r\\n_reveille_ concerning your execution. Also some notes for the guidance\\r\\nof the provost-marshal in arranging the details of that event.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I hope, General, the spectacle will be intelligently arranged, for I\\r\\nshall attend it myself.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Have you any arrangements of your own that you wish to make? Do you\\r\\nwish to see a chaplain, for example?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I could hardly secure a longer rest for myself by depriving him of some\\r\\nof his.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Good God, man! do you mean to go to your death with nothing but jokes\\r\\nupon your lips? Do you know that this is a serious matter?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How can I know that? I have never been dead in all my life. I have\\r\\nheard that death is a serious matter, but never from any of those who\\r\\nhave experienced it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe general was silent for a moment; the man interested, perhaps amused\\r\\nhim--a type not previously encountered.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Death,\" he said, \"is at least a loss--a loss of such happiness as we\\r\\nhave, and of opportunities for more.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"A loss of which we shall never be conscious can be borne with composure\\r\\nand therefore expected without apprehension. You must have observed,\\r\\nGeneral, that of all the dead men with whom it is your soldierly\\r\\npleasure to strew your path none shows signs of regret.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If the being dead is not a regrettable condition, yet the becoming so--\\r\\nthe act of dying--appears to be distinctly disagreeable to one who has\\r\\nnot lost the power to feel.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Pain is disagreeable, no doubt. I never suffer it without more or less\\r\\ndiscomfort. But he who lives longest is most exposed to it. What you\\r\\ncall dying is simply the last pain--there is really no such thing as\\r\\ndying. Suppose, for illustration, that I attempt to escape. You lift the\\r\\nrevolver that you are courteously concealing in your lap, and--\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe general blushed like a girl, then laughed softly, disclosing his\\r\\nbrilliant teeth, made a slight inclination of his handsome head and said\\r\\nnothing. The spy continued: \"You fire, and I have in my stomach what I\\r\\ndid not swallow. I fall, but am not dead. After a half-hour of agony I\\r\\nam dead. But at any given instant of that half-hour I was either alive\\r\\nor dead. There is no transition period.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"When I am hanged to-morrow morning it will be quite the same; while\\r\\nconscious I shall be living; when dead, unconscious. Nature appears to\\r\\nhave ordered the matter quite in my interest--the way that I should have\\r\\nordered it myself. It is so simple,\" he added with a smile, \"that it\\r\\nseems hardly worth while to be hanged at all.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the finish of his remarks there was a long silence. The general sat\\r\\nimpassive, looking into the man\\'s face, but apparently not attentive to\\r\\nwhat had been said. It was as if his eyes had mounted guard over the\\r\\nprisoner while his mind concerned itself with other matters. Presently\\r\\nhe drew a long, deep breath, shuddered, as one awakened from a dreadful\\r\\ndream, and exclaimed almost inaudibly: \"Death is horrible!\"--this man of\\r\\ndeath.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It was horrible to our savage ancestors,\" said the spy, gravely,\\r\\n\"because they had not enough intelligence to dissociate the idea of\\r\\nconsciousness from the idea of the physical forms in which it is\\r\\nmanifested--as an even lower order of intelligence, that of the monkey,\\r\\nfor example, may be unable to imagine a house without inhabitants, and\\r\\nseeing a ruined hut fancies a suffering occupant. To us it is horrible\\r\\nbecause we have inherited the tendency to think it so, accounting for\\r\\nthe notion by wild and fanciful theories of another world--as names of\\r\\nplaces give rise to legends explaining them and reasonless conduct to\\r\\nphilosophies in justification. You can hang me, General, but there your\\r\\npower of evil ends; you cannot condemn me to heaven.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe general appeared not to have heard; the spy\\'s talk had merely turned\\r\\nhis thoughts into an unfamiliar channel, but there they pursued their\\r\\nwill independently to conclusions of their own. The storm had ceased,\\r\\nand something of the solemn spirit of the night had imparted itself to\\r\\nhis reflections, giving them the sombre tinge of a supernatural dread.\\r\\nPerhaps there was an element of prescience in it. \"I should not like to\\r\\ndie,\" he said--\"not to-night.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was interrupted--if, indeed, he had intended to speak further--by the\\r\\nentrance of an officer of his staff, Captain Hasterlick, the\\r\\nprovost-marshal. This recalled him to himself; the absent look passed\\r\\naway from his face.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Captain,\" he said, acknowledging the officer\\'s salute, \"this man is a\\r\\nYankee spy captured inside our lines with incriminating papers on him.\\r\\nHe has confessed. How is the weather?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The storm is over, sir, and the moon shining.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Good; take a file of men, conduct him at once to the parade ground, and\\r\\nshoot him.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nA sharp cry broke from the spy\\'s lips. He threw himself forward, thrust\\r\\nout his neck, expanded his eyes, clenched his hands.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Good God!\" he cried hoarsely, almost inarticulately; \"you do not mean\\r\\nthat! You forget--I am not to die until morning.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have said nothing of morning,\" replied the general, coldly; \"that was\\r\\nan assumption of your own. You die now.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But, General, I beg--I implore you to remember; I am to hang! It will\\r\\ntake some time to erect the gallows--two hours--an hour. Spies are\\r\\nhanged; I have rights under military law. For Heaven\\'s sake, General,\\r\\nconsider how short--\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Captain, observe my directions.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe officer drew his sword and fixing his eyes upon the prisoner pointed\\r\\nsilently to the opening of the tent. The prisoner hesitated; the officer\\r\\ngrasped him by the collar and pushed him gently forward. As he\\r\\napproached the tent pole the frantic man sprang to it and with cat-like\\r\\nagility seized the handle of the bowie-knife, plucked the weapon from\\r\\nthe scabbard and thrusting the captain aside leaped upon the general\\r\\nwith the fury of a madman, hurling him to the ground and falling\\r\\nheadlong upon him as he lay. The table was overturned, the candle\\r\\nextinguished and they fought blindly in the darkness. The\\r\\nprovost-marshal sprang to the assistance of his Superior officer and was\\r\\nhimself prostrated upon the struggling forms. Curses and inarticulate\\r\\ncries of rage and pain came from the welter of limbs and bodies; the\\r\\ntent came down upon them and beneath its hampering and enveloping folds\\r\\nthe struggle went on. Private Tassman, returning from his errand and\\r\\ndimly conjecturing the situation, threw down his rifle and laying hold\\r\\nof the flouncing canvas at random vainly tried to drag it off the men\\r\\nunder it; and the sentinel who paced up and down in front, not daring to\\r\\nleave his beat though the skies should fall, discharged his rifle. The\\r\\nreport alarmed the camp; drums beat the long roll and bugles sounded the\\r\\nassembly, bringing swarms of half-clad men into the moonlight, dressing\\r\\nas they ran, and falling into line at the sharp commands of their\\r\\nofficers. This was well; being in line the men were under control; they\\r\\nstood at arms while the general\\'s staff and the men of his escort\\r\\nbrought order out of confusion by lifting off the fallen tent and\\r\\npulling apart the breathless and bleeding actors in that strange\\r\\ncontention.\\r\\n\\r\\nBreathless, indeed, was one: the captain was dead; the handle of the\\r\\nbowie-knife, protruding from his throat, was pressed back beneath his\\r\\nchin until the end had caught in the angle of the jaw and the hand that\\r\\ndelivered the blow had been unable to remove the weapon. In the dead\\r\\nman\\'s hand was his sword, clenched with a grip that defied the strength\\r\\nof the living. Its blade was streaked with red to the hilt.\\r\\n\\r\\nLifted to his feet, the general sank back to the earth with a moan and\\r\\nfainted. Besides his bruises he had two sword-thrusts--one through the\\r\\nthigh, the other through the shoulder.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe spy had suffered the least damage. Apart from a broken right arm,\\r\\nhis wounds were such only as might have been incurred in an ordinary\\r\\ncombat with nature\\'s weapons. But he was dazed and seemed hardly to know\\r\\nwhat had occurred. He shrank away from those attending him, cowered upon\\r\\nthe ground and uttered unintelligible remonstrances. His face, swollen\\r\\nby blows and stained with gouts of blood, nevertheless showed white\\r\\nbeneath his disheveled hair--as white as that of a corpse.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The man is not insane,\" said the surgeon, preparing bandages and\\r\\nreplying to a question; \"he is suffering from fright. Who and what is\\r\\nhe?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nPrivate Tassman began to explain. It was the opportunity of his life; he\\r\\nomitted nothing that could in any way accentuate the importance of his\\r\\nown relation to the night\\'s events. When he had finished his story and\\r\\nwas ready to begin it again nobody gave him any attention.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe general had now recovered consciousness. He raised himself upon his\\r\\nelbow, looked about him, and, seeing the spy crouching by a camp-fire,\\r\\nguarded, said simply:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Take that man to the parade ground and shoot him.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The general\\'s mind wanders,\" said an officer standing near.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"His mind does _not_ wander,\" the adjutant-general said. \"I have a\\r\\nmemorandum from him about this business; he had given that same order to\\r\\nHasterlick\"--with a motion of the hand toward the dead provost-marshal--\\r\\n\"and, by God! it shall be executed.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nTen minutes later Sergeant Parker Adderson, of the Federal army,\\r\\nphilosopher and wit, kneeling in the moonlight and begging incoherently\\r\\nfor his life, was shot to death by twenty men. As the volley rang out\\r\\nupon the keen air of the midnight, General Clavering, lying white and\\r\\nstill in the red glow of the camp-fire, opened his big blue eyes, looked\\r\\npleasantly upon those about him and said: \"How silent it all is!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe surgeon looked at the adjutant-general, gravely and significantly.\\r\\nThe patient\\'s eyes slowly closed, and thus he lay for a few moments;\\r\\nthen, his face suffused with a smile of ineffable sweetness, he said,\\r\\nfaintly: \"I suppose this must be death,\" and so passed away.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAN AFFAIR OF OUTPOSTS\\r\\n\\r\\nI\\r\\n\\r\\nCONCERNING THE WISH TO BE DEAD\\r\\n\\r\\nTwo men sat in conversation. One was the Governor of the State. The year\\r\\nwas 1861; the war was on and the Governor already famous for the\\r\\nintelligence and zeal with which he directed all the powers and\\r\\nresources of his State to the service of the Union.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What! _you_?\" the Governor was saying in evident surprise--\"you too\\r\\nwant a military commission? Really, the fifing and drumming must have\\r\\neffected a profound alteration in your convictions. In my character of\\r\\nrecruiting sergeant I suppose I ought not to be fastidious, but\"--there\\r\\nwas a touch of irony in his manner--\"well, have you forgotten that an\\r\\noath of allegiance is required?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have altered neither my convictions nor my sympathies,\" said the\\r\\nother, tranquilly. \"While my sympathies are with the South, as you do me\\r\\nthe honor to recollect, I have never doubted that the North was in the\\r\\nright. I am a Southerner in fact and in feeling, but it is my habit in\\r\\nmatters of importance to act as I think, not as I feel.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Governor was absently tapping his desk with a pencil; he did not\\r\\nimmediately reply. After a while he said: \"I have heard that there are\\r\\nall kinds of men in the world, so I suppose there are some like that,\\r\\nand doubtless you think yourself one. I\\'ve known you a long time and--\\r\\npardon me--I don\\'t think so.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Then I am to understand that my application is denied?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Unless you can remove my belief that your Southern sympathies are in\\r\\nsome degree a disqualification, yes. I do not doubt your good faith, and\\r\\nI know you to be abundantly fitted by intelligence and special training\\r\\nfor the duties of an officer. Your convictions, you say, favor the Union\\r\\ncause, but I prefer a man with his heart in it. The heart is what men\\r\\nfight with.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Look here, Governor,\" said the younger man, with a smile that had more\\r\\nlight than warmth: \"I have something up my sleeve--a qualification which\\r\\nI had hoped it would not be necessary to mention. A great military\\r\\nauthority has given a simple recipe for being a good soldier: \\'Try\\r\\nalways to get yourself killed.\\' It is with that purpose that I wish to\\r\\nenter the service. I am not, perhaps, much of a patriot, but I wish to\\r\\nbe dead.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Governor looked at him rather sharply, then a little coldly. \"There\\r\\nis a simpler and franker way,\" he said.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"In my family, sir,\" was the reply, \"we do not do that--no Armisted has\\r\\never done that.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nA long silence ensued and neither man looked at the other. Presently the\\r\\nGovernor lifted his eyes from the pencil, which had resumed its tapping,\\r\\nand said:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Who is she?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My wife.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Governor tossed the pencil into the desk, rose and walked two or\\r\\nthree times across the room. Then he turned to Armisted, who also had\\r\\nrisen, looked at him more coldly than before and said: \"But the man--\\r\\nwould it not be better that he--could not the country spare him better\\r\\nthan it can spare you? Or are the Armisteds opposed to \\'the unwritten\\r\\nlaw\\'?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Armisteds, apparently, could feel an insult: the face of the younger\\r\\nman flushed, then paled, but he subdued himself to the service of his\\r\\npurpose.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The man\\'s identity is unknown to me,\" he said, calmly enough.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Pardon me,\" said the Governor, with even less of visible contrition\\r\\nthan commonly underlies those words. After a moment\\'s reflection he\\r\\nadded: \"I shall send you to-morrow a captain\\'s commission in the Tenth\\r\\nInfantry, now at Nashville, Tennessee. Good night.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Good night, sir. I thank you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nLeft alone, the Governor remained for a time motionless, leaning against\\r\\nhis desk. Presently he shrugged his shoulders as if throwing off a\\r\\nburden. \"This is a bad business,\" he said.\\r\\n\\r\\nSeating himself at a reading-table before the fire, he took up the book\\r\\nnearest his hand, absently opening it. His eyes fell upon this sentence:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"When God made it necessary for an unfaithful wife to lie about her\\r\\nhusband in justification of her own sins He had the tenderness to endow\\r\\nmen with the folly to believe her.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe looked at the title of the book; it was, _His Excellency the Fool_.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe flung the volume into the fire.\\r\\n\\r\\nII\\r\\n\\r\\nHOW TO SAY WHAT IS WORTH HEARING\\r\\n\\r\\nThe enemy, defeated in two days of battle at Pittsburg Landing, had\\r\\nsullenly retired to Corinth, whence he had come. For manifest\\r\\nincompetence Grant, whose beaten army had been saved from destruction\\r\\nand capture by Buell\\'s soldierly activity and skill, had been relieved\\r\\nof his command, which nevertheless had not been given to Buell, but to\\r\\nHalleck, a man of unproved powers, a theorist, sluggish, irresolute.\\r\\nFoot by foot his troops, always deployed in line-of-battle to resist the\\r\\nenemy\\'s bickering skirmishers, always entrenching against the columns\\r\\nthat never came, advanced across the thirty miles of forest and swamp\\r\\ntoward an antagonist prepared to vanish at contact, like a ghost at\\r\\ncock-crow. It was a campaign of \"excursions and alarums,\" of\\r\\nreconnoissances and counter-marches, of cross-purposes and countermanded\\r\\norders. For weeks the solemn farce held attention, luring distinguished\\r\\ncivilians from fields of political ambition to see what they safely\\r\\ncould of the horrors of war. Among these was our friend the Governor. At\\r\\nthe headquarters of the army and in the camps of the troops from his\\r\\nState he was a familiar figure, attended by the several members of his\\r\\npersonal staff, showily horsed, faultlessly betailored and bravely\\r\\nsilk-hatted. Things of charm they were, rich in suggestions of peaceful\\r\\nlands beyond a sea of strife. The bedraggled soldier looked up from his\\r\\ntrench as they passed, leaned upon his spade and audibly damned them to\\r\\nsignify his sense of their ornamental irrelevance to the austerities of\\r\\nhis trade.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I think, Governor,\" said General Masterson one day, going into informal\\r\\nsession atop of his horse and throwing one leg across the pommel of his\\r\\nsaddle, his favorite posture--\"I think I would not ride any farther in\\r\\nthat direction if I were you. We\\'ve nothing out there but a line of\\r\\nskirmishers. That, I presume, is why I was directed to put these siege\\r\\nguns here: if the skirmishers are driven in the enemy will die of\\r\\ndejection at being unable to haul them away--they\\'re a trifle heavy.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is reason to fear that the unstrained quality of this military\\r\\nhumor dropped not as the gentle rain from heaven upon the place beneath\\r\\nthe civilian\\'s silk hat. Anyhow he abated none of his dignity in\\r\\nrecognition.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I understand,\" he said, gravely, \"that some of my men are out there--a\\r\\ncompany of the Tenth, commanded by Captain Armisted. I should like to\\r\\nmeet him if you do not mind.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He is worth meeting. But there\\'s a bad bit of jungle out there, and I\\r\\nshould advise that you leave your horse and\"--with a look at the\\r\\nGovernor\\'s retinue--\"your other impedimenta.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Governor went forward alone and on foot. In a half-hour he had\\r\\npushed through a tangled undergrowth covering a boggy soil and entered\\r\\nupon firm and more open ground. Here he found a half-company of infantry\\r\\nlounging behind a line of stacked rifles. The men wore their\\r\\naccoutrements--their belts, cartridge-boxes, haversacks and canteens.\\r\\nSome lying at full length on the dry leaves were fast asleep: others in\\r\\nsmall groups gossiped idly of this and that; a few played at cards; none\\r\\nwas far from the line of stacked arms. To the civilian\\'s eye the scene\\r\\nwas one of carelessness, confusion, indifference; a soldier would have\\r\\nobserved expectancy and readiness.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt a little distance apart an officer in fatigue uniform, armed, sat on\\r\\na fallen tree noting the approach of the visitor, to whom a sergeant,\\r\\nrising from one of the groups, now came forward.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I wish to see Captain Armisted,\" said the Governor.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe sergeant eyed him narrowly, saying nothing, pointed to the officer,\\r\\nand taking a rifle from one of the stacks, accompanied him.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"This man wants to see you, sir,\" said the sergeant, saluting. The\\r\\nofficer rose.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt would have been a sharp eye that would have recognized him. His hair,\\r\\nwhich but a few months before had been brown, was streaked with gray.\\r\\nHis face, tanned by exposure, was seamed as with age. A long livid scar\\r\\nacross the forehead marked the stroke of a sabre; one cheek was drawn\\r\\nand puckered by the work of a bullet. Only a woman of the loyal North\\r\\nwould have thought the man handsome.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Armisted--Captain,\" said the Governor, extending his hand, \"do you not\\r\\nknow me?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I know you, sir, and I salute you--as the Governor of my State.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nLifting his right hand to the level of his eyes he threw it outward and\\r\\ndownward. In the code of military etiquette there is no provision for\\r\\nshaking hands. That of the civilian was withdrawn. If he felt either\\r\\nsurprise or chagrin his face did not betray it.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is the hand that signed your commission,\" he said.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And it is the hand--\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe sentence remains unfinished. The sharp report of a rifle came from\\r\\nthe front, followed by another and another. A bullet hissed through the\\r\\nforest and struck a tree near by. The men sprang from the ground and\\r\\neven before the captain\\'s high, clear voice was done intoning the\\r\\ncommand \"At-ten-tion!\" had fallen into line in rear of the stacked arms.\\r\\nAgain--and now through the din of a crackling fusillade--sounded the\\r\\nstrong, deliberate sing-song of authority: \"Take... arms!\" followed by\\r\\nthe rattle of unlocking bayonets.\\r\\n\\r\\nBullets from the unseen enemy were now flying thick and fast, though\\r\\nmostly well spent and emitting the humming sound which signified\\r\\ninterference by twigs and rotation in the plane of flight. Two or three\\r\\nof the men in the line were already struck and down. A few wounded men\\r\\ncame limping awkwardly out of the undergrowth from the skirmish line in\\r\\nfront; most of them did not pause, but held their way with white faces\\r\\nand set teeth to the rear.\\r\\n\\r\\nSuddenly there was a deep, jarring report in front, followed by the\\r\\nstartling rush of a shell, which passing overhead exploded in the edge\\r\\nof a thicket, setting afire the fallen leaves. Penetrating the din--\\r\\nseeming to float above it like the melody of a soaring bird--rang the\\r\\nslow, aspirated monotones of the captain\\'s several commands, without\\r\\nemphasis, without accent, musical and restful as an evensong under the\\r\\nharvest moon. Familiar with this tranquilizing chant in moments of\\r\\nimminent peril, these raw soldiers of less than a year\\'s training\\r\\nyielded themselves to the spell, executing its mandates with the\\r\\ncomposure and precision of veterans. Even the distinguished civilian\\r\\nbehind his tree, hesitating between pride and terror, was accessible to\\r\\nits charm and suasion. He was conscious of a fortified resolution and\\r\\nran away only when the skirmishers, under orders to rally on the\\r\\nreserve, came out of the woods like hunted hares and formed on the left\\r\\nof the stiff little line, breathing hard and thankful for the boon of\\r\\nbreath.\\r\\n\\r\\nIII\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE FIGHTING OF ONE WHOSE HEART WAS NOT IN THE QUARREL\\r\\n\\r\\nGuided in his retreat by that of the fugitive wounded, the Governor\\r\\nstruggled bravely to the rear through the \"bad bit of jungle.\" He was\\r\\nwell winded and a trifle confused. Excepting a single rifle-shot now and\\r\\nagain, there was no sound of strife behind him; the enemy was pulling\\r\\nhimself together for a new onset against an antagonist of whose numbers\\r\\nand tactical disposition he was in doubt. The fugitive felt that he\\r\\nwould probably be spared to his country, and only commended the\\r\\narrangements of Providence to that end, but in leaping a small brook in\\r\\nmore open ground one of the arrangements incurred the mischance of a\\r\\ndisabling sprain at the ankle. He was unable to continue his flight, for\\r\\nhe was too fat to hop, and after several vain attempts, causing\\r\\nintolerable pain, seated himself on the earth to nurse his ignoble\\r\\ndisability and deprecate the military situation.\\r\\n\\r\\nA brisk renewal of the firing broke out and stray bullets came flitting\\r\\nand droning by. Then came the crash of two clean, definite volleys,\\r\\nfollowed by a continuous rattle, through which he heard the yells and\\r\\ncheers of the combatants, punctuated by thunderclaps of cannon. All this\\r\\ntold him that Armisted\\'s little command was bitterly beset and fighting\\r\\nat close quarters. The wounded men whom he had distanced began to\\r\\nstraggle by on either hand, their numbers visibly augmented by new\\r\\nlevies from the line. Singly and by twos and threes, some supporting\\r\\ncomrades more desperately hurt than themselves, but all deaf to his\\r\\nappeals for assistance, they sifted through the underbrush and\\r\\ndisappeared. The firing was increasingly louder and more distinct, and\\r\\npresently the ailing fugitives were succeeded by men who strode with a\\r\\nfirmer tread, occasionally facing about and discharging their pieces,\\r\\nthen doggedly resuming their retreat, reloading as they walked. Two or\\r\\nthree fell as he looked, and lay motionless. One had enough of life left\\r\\nin him to make a pitiful attempt to drag himself to cover. A passing\\r\\ncomrade paused beside him long enough to fire, appraised the poor\\r\\ndevil\\'s disability with a look and moved sullenly on, inserting a\\r\\ncartridge in his weapon.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn all this was none of the pomp of war--no hint of glory. Even in his\\r\\ndistress and peril the helpless civilian could not forbear to contrast\\r\\nit with the gorgeous parades and reviews held in honor of himself--with\\r\\nthe brilliant uniforms, the music, the banners, and the marching. It was\\r\\nan ugly and sickening business: to all that was artistic in his nature,\\r\\nrevolting, brutal, in bad taste.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ugh!\" he grunted, shuddering--\"this is beastly! Where is the charm of\\r\\nit all? Where are the elevated sentiments, the devotion, the heroism,\\r\\nthe--\"\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom a point somewhere near, in the direction of the pursuing enemy,\\r\\nrose the clear, deliberate sing-song of Captain Armisted.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Stead-y, men--stead-y. Halt! Com-mence fir-ing.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe rattle of fewer than a score of rifles could be distinguished\\r\\nthrough the general uproar, and again that penetrating falsetto:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Cease fir-ing. In re-treat... maaarch!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIn a few moments this remnant had drifted slowly past the Governor, all\\r\\nto the right of him as they faced in retiring, the men deployed at\\r\\nintervals of a half-dozen paces. At the extreme left and a few yards\\r\\nbehind came the captain. The civilian called out his name, but he did\\r\\nnot hear. A swarm of men in gray now broke out of cover in pursuit,\\r\\nmaking directly for the spot where the Governor lay--some accident of\\r\\nthe ground had caused them to converge upon that point: their line had\\r\\nbecome a crowd. In a last struggle for life and liberty the Governor\\r\\nattempted to rise, and looking back the captain saw him. Promptly, but\\r\\nwith the same slow precision as before, he sang his commands:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Skirm-ish-ers, halt!\" The men stopped and according to rule turned to\\r\\nface the enemy.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ral-ly on the right!\"--and they came in at a run, fixing bayonets and\\r\\nforming loosely on the man at that end of the line.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Forward... to save the Gov-ern-or of your State... doub-le quick...\\r\\nmaaarch!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nOnly one man disobeyed this astonishing command! He was dead. With a\\r\\ncheer they sprang forward over the twenty or thirty paces between them\\r\\nand their task. The captain having a shorter distance to go arrived\\r\\nfirst--simultaneously with the enemy. A half-dozen hasty shots were\\r\\nfired at him, and the foremost man--a fellow of heroic stature, hatless\\r\\nand bare-breasted--made a vicious sweep at his head with a clubbed\\r\\nrifle. The officer parried the blow at the cost of a broken arm and\\r\\ndrove his sword to the hilt into the giant\\'s breast. As the body fell\\r\\nthe weapon was wrenched from his hand and before he could pluck his\\r\\nrevolver from the scabbard at his belt another man leaped upon him like\\r\\na tiger, fastening both hands upon his throat and bearing him backward\\r\\nupon the prostrate Governor, still struggling to rise. This man was\\r\\npromptly spitted upon the bayonet of a Federal sergeant and his\\r\\ndeath-gripe on the captain\\'s throat loosened by a kick upon each wrist.\\r\\nWhen the captain had risen he was at the rear of his men, who had all\\r\\npassed over and around him and were thrusting fiercely at their more\\r\\nnumerous but less coherent antagonists. Nearly all the rifles on both\\r\\nsides were empty and in the crush there was neither time nor room to\\r\\nreload. The Confederates were at a disadvantage in that most of them\\r\\nlacked bayonets; they fought by bludgeoning--and a clubbed rifle is a\\r\\nformidable arm. The sound of the conflict was a clatter like that of the\\r\\ninterlocking horns of battling bulls--now and then the pash of a crushed\\r\\nskull, an oath, or a grunt caused by the impact of a rifle\\'s muzzle\\r\\nagainst the abdomen transfixed by its bayonet. Through an opening made\\r\\nby the fall of one of his men Captain Armisted sprang, with his dangling\\r\\nleft arm; in his right hand a full-charged revolver, which he fired with\\r\\nrapidity and terrible effect into the thick of the gray crowd: but\\r\\nacross the bodies of the slain the survivors in the front were pushed\\r\\nforward by their comrades in the rear till again they breasted the\\r\\ntireless bayonets. There were fewer bayonets now to breast--a beggarly\\r\\nhalf-dozen, all told. A few minutes more of this rough work--a little\\r\\nfighting back to back--and all would be over.\\r\\n\\r\\nSuddenly a lively firing was heard on the right and the left: a fresh\\r\\nline of Federal skirmishers came forward at a run, driving before them\\r\\nthose parts of the Confederate line that had been separated by staying\\r\\nthe advance of the centre. And behind these new and noisy combatants, at\\r\\na distance of two or three hundred yards, could be seen, indistinct\\r\\namong the trees a line-of-battle!\\r\\n\\r\\nInstinctively before retiring, the crowd in gray made a tremendous rush\\r\\nupon its handful of antagonists, overwhelming them by mere momentum and,\\r\\nunable to use weapons in the crush, trampled them, stamped savagely on\\r\\ntheir limbs, their bodies, their necks, their faces; then retiring with\\r\\nbloody feet across its own dead it joined the general rout and the\\r\\nincident was at an end.\\r\\n\\r\\nIV\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE GREAT HONOR THE GREAT\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Governor, who had been unconscious, opened his eyes and stared about\\r\\nhim, slowly recalling the day\\'s events. A man in the uniform of a major\\r\\nwas kneeling beside him; he was a surgeon. Grouped about were the\\r\\ncivilian members of the Governor\\'s staff, their faces expressing a\\r\\nnatural solicitude regarding their offices. A little apart stood General\\r\\nMasterson addressing another officer and gesticulating with a cigar. He\\r\\nwas saying: \"It was the beautifulest fight ever made--by God, sir, it\\r\\nwas great!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe beauty and greatness were attested by a row of dead, trimly\\r\\ndisposed, and another of wounded, less formally placed, restless,\\r\\nhalf-naked, but bravely bebandaged.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How do you feel, sir?\" said the surgeon. \"I find no wound.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I think I am all right,\" the patient replied, sitting up. \"It is that\\r\\nankle.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe surgeon transferred his attention to the ankle, cutting away the\\r\\nboot. All eyes followed the knife.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn moving the leg a folded paper was uncovered. The patient picked it up\\r\\nand carelessly opened it. It was a letter three months old, signed\\r\\n\"Julia.\" Catching sight of his name in it he read it. It was nothing\\r\\nvery remarkable--merely a weak woman\\'s confession of unprofitable sin--\\r\\nthe penitence of a faithless wife deserted by her betrayer. The letter\\r\\nhad fallen from the pocket of Captain Armisted; the reader quietly\\r\\ntransferred it to his own.\\r\\n\\r\\nAn aide-de-camp rode up and dismounted. Advancing to the Governor he\\r\\nsaluted.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Sir,\" he said, \"I am sorry to find you wounded--the Commanding General\\r\\nhas not been informed. He presents his compliments and I am directed to\\r\\nsay that he has ordered for to-morrow a grand review of the reserve\\r\\ncorps in your honor. I venture to add that the General\\'s carriage is at\\r\\nyour service if you are able to attend.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Be pleased to say to the Commanding General that I am deeply touched by\\r\\nhis kindness. If you have the patience to wait a few moments you shall\\r\\nconvey a more definite reply.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe smiled brightly and glancing at the surgeon and his assistants added:\\r\\n\"At present--if you will permit an allusion to the horrors of peace--I\\r\\nam \\'in the hands of my friends.\\'\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe humor of the great is infectious; all laughed who heard.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Where is Captain Armisted?\" the Governor asked, not altogether\\r\\ncarelessly.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe surgeon looked up from his work, pointing silently to the nearest\\r\\nbody in the row of dead, the features discreetly covered with a\\r\\nhandkerchief. It was so near that the great man could have laid his hand\\r\\nupon it, but he did not. He may have feared that it would bleed.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE STORY OF A CONSCIENCE\\r\\n\\r\\nI\\r\\n\\r\\nCaptain Parrol Hartroy stood at the advanced post of his picket-guard,\\r\\ntalking in low tones with the sentinel. This post was on a turnpike\\r\\nwhich bisected the captain\\'s camp, a half-mile in rear, though the camp\\r\\nwas not in sight from that point. The officer was apparently giving the\\r\\nsoldier certain instructions--was perhaps merely inquiring if all were\\r\\nquiet in front. As the two stood talking a man approached them from the\\r\\ndirection of the camp, carelessly whistling, and was promptly halted by\\r\\nthe soldier. He was evidently a civilian--a tall person, coarsely clad\\r\\nin the home-made stuff of yellow gray, called \"butternut,\" which was\\r\\nmen\\'s only wear in the latter days of the Confederacy. On his head was a\\r\\nslouch felt hat, once white, from beneath which hung masses of uneven\\r\\nhair, seemingly unacquainted with either scissors or comb. The man\\'s\\r\\nface was rather striking; a broad forehead, high nose, and thin cheeks,\\r\\nthe mouth invisible in the full dark beard, which seemed as neglected as\\r\\nthe hair. The eyes were large and had that steadiness and fixity of\\r\\nattention which so frequently mark a considering intelligence and a will\\r\\nnot easily turned from its purpose--so say those physiognomists who have\\r\\nthat kind of eyes. On the whole, this was a man whom one would be likely\\r\\nto observe and be observed by. He carried a walking-stick freshly cut\\r\\nfrom the forest and his ailing cowskin boots were white with dust.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Show your pass,\" said the Federal soldier, a trifle more imperiously\\r\\nperhaps than he would have thought necessary if he had not been under\\r\\nthe eye of his commander, who with folded arms looked on from the\\r\\nroadside.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'Lowed you\\'d rec\\'lect me, Gineral,\" said the wayfarer tranquilly, while\\r\\nproducing the paper from the pocket of his coat. There was something in\\r\\nhis tone--perhaps a faint suggestion of irony--which made his elevation\\r\\nof his obstructor to exalted rank less agreeable to that worthy warrior\\r\\nthan promotion is commonly found to be. \"You-all have to be purty\\r\\npertickler, I reckon,\" he added, in a more conciliatory tone, as if in\\r\\nhalf-apology for being halted.\\r\\n\\r\\nHaving read the pass, with his rifle resting on the ground, the soldier\\r\\nhanded the document back without a word, shouldered his weapon, and\\r\\nreturned to his commander. The civilian passed on in the middle of the\\r\\nroad, and when he had penetrated the circumjacent Confederacy a few\\r\\nyards resumed his whistling and was soon out of sight beyond an angle in\\r\\nthe road, which at that point entered a thin forest. Suddenly the\\r\\nofficer undid his arms from his breast, drew a revolver from his belt\\r\\nand sprang forward at a run in the same direction, leaving his sentinel\\r\\nin gaping astonishment at his post. After making to the various visible\\r\\nforms of nature a solemn promise to be damned, that gentleman resumed\\r\\nthe air of stolidity which is supposed to be appropriate to a state of\\r\\nalert military attention.\\r\\n\\r\\nII\\r\\n\\r\\nCaptain Hartroy held an independent command. His force consisted of a\\r\\ncompany of infantry, a squadron of cavalry, and a section of artillery,\\r\\ndetached from the army to which they belonged, to defend an important\\r\\ndefile in the Cumberland Mountains in Tennessee. It was a field\\r\\nofficer\\'s command held by a line officer promoted from the ranks, where\\r\\nhe had quietly served until \"discovered.\" His post was one of\\r\\nexceptional peril; its defense entailed a heavy responsibility and he\\r\\nhad wisely been given corresponding discretionary powers, all the more\\r\\nnecessary because of his distance from the main army, the precarious\\r\\nnature of his communications and the lawless character of the enemy\\'s\\r\\nirregular troops infesting that region. He had strongly fortified his\\r\\nlittle camp, which embraced a village of a half-dozen dwellings and a\\r\\ncountry store, and had collected a considerable quantity of supplies. To\\r\\na few resident civilians of known loyalty, with whom it was desirable to\\r\\ntrade, and of whose services in various ways he sometimes availed\\r\\nhimself, he had given written passes admitting them within his lines. It\\r\\nis easy to understand that an abuse of this privilege in the interest of\\r\\nthe enemy might entail serious consequences. Captain Hartroy had made an\\r\\norder to the effect that any one so abusing it would be summarily shot.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile the sentinel had been examining the civilian\\'s pass the captain\\r\\nhad eyed the latter narrowly. He thought his appearance familiar and had\\r\\nat first no doubt of having given him the pass which had satisfied the\\r\\nsentinel. It was not until the man had got out of sight and hearing that\\r\\nhis identity was disclosed by a revealing light from memory. With\\r\\nsoldierly promptness of decision the officer had acted on the\\r\\nrevelation.\\r\\n\\r\\nIII\\r\\n\\r\\nTo any but a singularly self-possessed man the apparition of an officer\\r\\nof the military forces, formidably clad, bearing in one hand a sheathed\\r\\nsword and in the other a cocked revolver, and rushing in furious\\r\\npursuit, is no doubt disquieting to a high degree; upon the man to whom\\r\\nthe pursuit was in this instance directed it appeared to have no other\\r\\neffect than somewhat to intensify his tranquillity. He might easily\\r\\nenough have escaped into the forest to the right or the left, but chose\\r\\nanother course of action--turned and quietly faced the captain, saying\\r\\nas he came up: \"I reckon ye must have something to say to me, which ye\\r\\ndisremembered. What mout it be, neighbor?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the \"neighbor\" did not answer, being engaged in the unneighborly act\\r\\nof covering him with a cocked pistol.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Surrender,\" said the captain as calmly as a slight breathlessness from\\r\\nexertion would permit, \"or you die.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was no menace in the manner of this demand; that was all in the\\r\\nmatter and in the means of enforcing it. There was, too, something not\\r\\naltogether reassuring in the cold gray eyes that glanced along the\\r\\nbarrel of the weapon. For a moment the two men stood looking at each\\r\\nother in silence; then the civilian, with no appearance of fear--with as\\r\\ngreat apparent unconcern as when complying with the less austere demand\\r\\nof the sentinel--slowly pulled from his pocket the paper which had\\r\\nsatisfied that humble functionary and held it out, saying:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I reckon this \\'ere parss from Mister Hartroy is--\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The pass is a forgery,\" the officer said, interrupting. \"I am Captain\\r\\nHartroy--and you are Dramer Brune.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIt would have required a sharp eye to observe the slight pallor of the\\r\\ncivilian\\'s face at these words, and the only other manifestation\\r\\nattesting their significance was a voluntary relaxation of the thumb and\\r\\nfingers holding the dishonored paper, which, falling to the road,\\r\\nunheeded, was rolled by a gentle wind and then lay still, with a coating\\r\\nof dust, as in humiliation for the lie that it bore. A moment later the\\r\\ncivilian, still looking unmoved into the barrel of the pistol, said:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, I am Dramer Brune, a Confederate spy, and your prisoner. I have on\\r\\nmy person, as you will soon discover, a plan of your fort and its\\r\\narmament, a statement of the distribution of your men and their number,\\r\\na map of the approaches, showing the positions of all your outposts. My\\r\\nlife is fairly yours, but if you wish it taken in a more formal way than\\r\\nby your own hand, and if you are willing to spare me the indignity of\\r\\nmarching into camp at the muzzle of your pistol, I promise you that I\\r\\nwill neither resist, escape, nor remonstrate, but will submit to\\r\\nwhatever penalty may be imposed.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe officer lowered his pistol, uncocked it, and thrust it into its\\r\\nplace in his belt. Brune advanced a step, extending his right hand.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is the hand of a traitor and a spy,\" said the officer coldly, and\\r\\ndid not take it. The other bowed.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Come,\" said the captain, \"let us go to camp; you shall not die until\\r\\nto-morrow morning.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe turned his back upon his prisoner, and these two enigmatical men\\r\\nretraced their steps and soon passed the sentinel, who expressed his\\r\\ngeneral sense of things by a needless and exaggerated salute to his\\r\\ncommander.\\r\\n\\r\\nIV\\r\\n\\r\\nEarly on the morning after these events the two men, captor and captive,\\r\\nsat in the tent of the former. A table was between them on which lay,\\r\\namong a number of letters, official and private, which the captain had\\r\\nwritten during the night, the incriminating papers found upon the spy.\\r\\nThat gentleman had slept through the night in an adjoining tent,\\r\\nunguarded. Both, having breakfasted, were now smoking.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Mr. Brune,\" said Captain Hartroy, \"you probably do not understand why I\\r\\nrecognized you in your disguise, nor how I was aware of your name.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have not sought to learn, Captain,\" the prisoner said with quiet\\r\\ndignity.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Nevertheless I should like you to know--if the story will not offend.\\r\\nYou will perceive that my knowledge of you goes back to the autumn of\\r\\n1861. At that time you were a private in an Ohio regiment--a brave and\\r\\ntrusted soldier. To the surprise and grief of your officers and comrades\\r\\nyou deserted and went over to the enemy. Soon afterward you were\\r\\ncaptured in a skirmish, recognized, tried by court-martial and sentenced\\r\\nto be shot. Awaiting the execution of the sentence you were confined,\\r\\nunfettered, in a freight car standing on a side track of a railway.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"At Grafton, Virginia,\" said Brune, pushing the ashes from his cigar\\r\\nwith the little finger of the hand holding it, and without looking up.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"At Grafton, Virginia,\" the captain repeated. \"One dark and stormy night\\r\\na soldier who had just returned from a long, fatiguing march was put on\\r\\nguard over you. He sat on a cracker box inside the car, near the door,\\r\\nhis rifle loaded and the bayonet fixed. You sat in a corner and his\\r\\norders were to kill you if you attempted to rise.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But if I _asked_ to rise he might call the corporal of the guard.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes. As the long silent hours wore away the soldier yielded to the\\r\\ndemands of nature: he himself incurred the death penalty by sleeping at\\r\\nhis post of duty.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You did.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What! you recognize me? you have known me all along?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe captain had risen and was walking the floor of his tent, visibly\\r\\nexcited. His face was flushed, the gray eyes had lost the cold, pitiless\\r\\nlook which they had shown when Brune had seen them over the pistol\\r\\nbarrel; they had softened wonderfully.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I knew you,\" said the spy, with his customary tranquillity, \"the moment\\r\\nyou faced me, demanding my surrender. In the circumstances it would have\\r\\nbeen hardly becoming in me to recall these matters. I am perhaps a\\r\\ntraitor, certainly a spy; but I should not wish to seem a suppliant.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe captain had paused in his walk and was facing his prisoner. There\\r\\nwas a singular huskiness in his voice as he spoke again.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Mr. Brune, whatever your conscience may permit you to be, you saved my\\r\\nlife at what you must have believed the cost of your own. Until I saw\\r\\nyou yesterday when halted by my sentinel I believed you dead--thought\\r\\nthat you had suffered the fate which through my own crime you might\\r\\neasily have escaped. You had only to step from the car and leave me to\\r\\ntake your place before the firing-squad. You had a divine compassion.\\r\\nYou pitied my fatigue. You let me sleep, watched over me, and as the\\r\\ntime drew near for the relief-guard to come and detect me in my crime,\\r\\nyou gently waked me. Ah, Brune, Brune, that was well done--that was\\r\\ngreat--that--\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe captain\\'s voice failed him; the tears were running down his face and\\r\\nsparkled upon his beard and his breast. Resuming his seat at the table,\\r\\nhe buried his face in his arms and sobbed. All else was silence.\\r\\n\\r\\nSuddenly the clear warble of a bugle was heard sounding the \"assembly.\"\\r\\nThe captain started and raised his wet face from his arms; it had turned\\r\\nghastly pale. Outside, in the sunlight, were heard the stir of the men\\r\\nfalling into line; the voices of the sergeants calling the roll; the\\r\\ntapping of the drummers as they braced their drums. The captain spoke\\r\\nagain:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I ought to have confessed my fault in order to relate the story of your\\r\\nmagnanimity; it might have procured you a pardon. A hundred times I\\r\\nresolved to do so, but shame prevented. Besides, your sentence was just\\r\\nand righteous. Well, Heaven forgive me! I said nothing, and my regiment\\r\\nwas soon afterward ordered to Tennessee and I never heard about you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It was all right, sir,\" said Brune, without visible emotion; \"I escaped\\r\\nand returned to my colors--the Confederate colors. I should like to add\\r\\nthat before deserting from the Federal service I had earnestly asked a\\r\\ndischarge, on the ground of altered convictions. I was answered by\\r\\npunishment.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ah, but if I had suffered the penalty of my crime--if you had not\\r\\ngenerously given me the life that I accepted without gratitude you would\\r\\nnot be again in the shadow and imminence of death.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe prisoner started slightly and a look of anxiety came into his face.\\r\\nOne would have said, too, that he was surprised. At that moment a\\r\\nlieutenant, the adjutant, appeared at the opening of the tent and\\r\\nsaluted. \"Captain,\" he said, \"the battalion is formed.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nCaptain Hartroy had recovered his composure. He turned to the officer\\r\\nand said: \"Lieutenant, go to Captain Graham and say that I direct him to\\r\\nassume command of the battalion and parade it outside the parapet. This\\r\\ngentleman is a deserter and a spy; he is to be shot to death in the\\r\\npresence of the troops. He will accompany you, unbound and unguarded.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile the adjutant waited at the door the two men inside the tent rose\\r\\nand exchanged ceremonious bows, Brune immediately retiring.\\r\\n\\r\\nHalf an hour later an old negro cook, the only person left in camp\\r\\nexcept the commander, was so startled by the sound of a volley of\\r\\nmusketry that he dropped the kettle that he was lifting from a fire. But\\r\\nfor his consternation and the hissing which the contents of the kettle\\r\\nmade among the embers, he might also have heard, nearer at hand, the\\r\\nsingle pistol shot with which Captain Hartroy renounced the life which\\r\\nin conscience he could no longer keep.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn compliance with the terms of a note that he left for the officer who\\r\\nsucceeded him in command, he was buried, like the deserter and spy,\\r\\nwithout military honors; and in the solemn shadow of the mountain which\\r\\nknows no more of war the two sleep well in long-forgotten graves.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nONE KIND OF OFFICER\\r\\n\\r\\nI\\r\\n\\r\\nOF THE USES OF CIVILITY\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Captain Ransome, it is not permitted to you to know _anything_. It is\\r\\nsufficient that you obey my order--which permit me to repeat. If you\\r\\nperceive any movement of troops in your front you are to open fire, and\\r\\nif attacked hold this position as long as you can. Do I make myself\\r\\nunderstood, sir?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Nothing could be plainer. Lieutenant Price,\"--this to an officer of his\\r\\nown battery, who had ridden up in time to hear the order--\"the general\\'s\\r\\nmeaning is clear, is it not?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Perfectly.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe lieutenant passed on to his post. For a moment General Cameron and\\r\\nthe commander of the battery sat in their saddles, looking at each other\\r\\nin silence. There was no more to say; apparently too much had already\\r\\nbeen said. Then the superior officer nodded coldly and turned his horse\\r\\nto ride away. The artillerist saluted slowly, gravely, and with extreme\\r\\nformality. One acquainted with the niceties of military etiquette would\\r\\nhave said that by his manner he attested a sense of the rebuke that he\\r\\nhad incurred. It is one of the important uses of civility to signify\\r\\nresentment.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the general had joined his staff and escort, awaiting him at a\\r\\nlittle distance, the whole cavalcade moved off toward the right of the\\r\\nguns and vanished in the fog. Captain Ransome was alone, silent,\\r\\nmotionless as an equestrian statue. The gray fog, thickening every\\r\\nmoment, closed in about him like a visible doom.\\r\\n\\r\\nII\\r\\n\\r\\nUNDER WHAT CIRCUMSTANCES MEN DO NOT WISH TO BE SHOT\\r\\n\\r\\nThe fighting of the day before had been desultory and indecisive. At the\\r\\npoints of collision the smoke of battle had hung in blue sheets among\\r\\nthe branches of the trees till beaten into nothing by the falling rain.\\r\\nIn the softened earth the wheels of cannon and ammunition wagons cut\\r\\ndeep, ragged furrows, and movements of infantry seemed impeded by the\\r\\nmud that clung to the soldiers\\' feet as, with soaken garments and rifles\\r\\nimperfectly protected by capes of overcoats they went dragging in\\r\\nsinuous lines hither and thither through dripping forest and flooded\\r\\nfield. Mounted officers, their heads protruding from rubber ponchos that\\r\\nglittered like black armor, picked their way, singly and in loose\\r\\ngroups, among the men, coming and going with apparent aimlessness and\\r\\ncommanding attention from nobody but one another. Here and there a dead\\r\\nman, his clothing defiled with earth, his face covered with a blanket or\\r\\nshowing yellow and claylike in the rain, added his dispiriting influence\\r\\nto that of the other dismal features of the scene and augmented the\\r\\ngeneral discomfort with a particular dejection. Very repulsive these\\r\\nwrecks looked--not at all heroic, and nobody was accessible to the\\r\\ninfection of their patriotic example. Dead upon the field of honor, yes;\\r\\nbut the field of honor was so very wet! It makes a difference.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe general engagement that all expected did not occur, none of the\\r\\nsmall advantages accruing, now to this side and now to that, in isolated\\r\\nand accidental collisions being followed up. Half-hearted attacks\\r\\nprovoked a sullen resistance which was satisfied with mere repulse.\\r\\nOrders were obeyed with mechanical fidelity; no one did any more than\\r\\nhis duty.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The army is cowardly to-day,\" said General Cameron, the commander of a\\r\\nFederal brigade, to his adjutant-general.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The army is cold,\" replied the officer addressed, \"and--yes, it doesn\\'t\\r\\nwish to be like that.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe pointed to one of the dead bodies, lying in a thin pool of yellow\\r\\nwater, its face and clothing bespattered with mud from hoof and wheel.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe army\\'s weapons seemed to share its military delinquency. The rattle\\r\\nof rifles sounded flat and contemptible. It had no meaning and scarcely\\r\\nroused to attention and expectancy the unengaged parts of the\\r\\nline-of-battle and the waiting reserves. Heard at a little distance, the\\r\\nreports of cannon were feeble in volume and _timbre_: they lacked sting\\r\\nand resonance. The guns seemed to be fired with light charges,\\r\\nunshotted. And so the futile day wore on to its dreary close, and then\\r\\nto a night of discomfort succeeded a day of apprehension.\\r\\n\\r\\nAn army has a personality. Beneath the individual thoughts and emotions\\r\\nof its component parts it thinks and feels as a unit. And in this large,\\r\\ninclusive sense of things lies a wiser wisdom than the mere sum of all\\r\\nthat it knows. On that dismal morning this great brute force, groping at\\r\\nthe bottom of a white ocean of fog among trees that seemed as sea weeds,\\r\\nhad a dumb consciousness that all was not well; that a day\\'s manoeuvring\\r\\nhad resulted in a faulty disposition of its parts, a blind diffusion of\\r\\nits strength. The men felt insecure and talked among themselves of such\\r\\ntactical errors as with their meager military vocabulary they were able\\r\\nto name. Field and line officers gathered in groups and spoke more\\r\\nlearnedly of what they apprehended with no greater clearness. Commanders\\r\\nof brigades and divisions looked anxiously to their connections on the\\r\\nright and on the left, sent staff officers on errands of inquiry and\\r\\npushed skirmish lines silently and cautiously forward into the dubious\\r\\nregion between the known and the unknown. At some points on the line the\\r\\ntroops, apparently of their own volition, constructed such defenses as\\r\\nthey could without the silent spade and the noisy ax.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne of these points was held by Captain Ransome\\'s battery of six guns.\\r\\nProvided always with intrenching tools, his men had labored with\\r\\ndiligence during the night, and now his guns thrust their black muzzles\\r\\nthrough the embrasures of a really formidable earthwork. It crowned a\\r\\nslight acclivity devoid of undergrowth and providing an unobstructed\\r\\nfire that would sweep the ground for an unknown distance in front. The\\r\\nposition could hardly have been better chosen. It had this peculiarity,\\r\\nwhich Captain Ransome, who was greatly addicted to the use of the\\r\\ncompass, had not failed to observe: it faced northward, whereas he knew\\r\\nthat the general line of the army must face eastward. In fact, that part\\r\\nof the line was \"refused\"--that is to say, bent backward, away from the\\r\\nenemy. This implied that Captain Ransome\\'s battery was somewhere near\\r\\nthe left flank of the army; for an army in line of battle retires its\\r\\nflanks if the nature of the ground will permit, they being its\\r\\nvulnerable points. Actually, Captain Ransome appeared to hold the\\r\\nextreme left of the line, no troops being visible in that direction\\r\\nbeyond his own. Immediately in rear of his guns occurred that\\r\\nconversation between him and his brigade commander, the concluding and\\r\\nmore picturesque part of which is reported above.\\r\\n\\r\\nIII\\r\\n\\r\\nHOW TO PLAY THE CANNON WITHOUT NOTES\\r\\n\\r\\nCaptain Ransome sat motionless and silent on horseback. A few yards away\\r\\nhis men were standing at their guns. Somewhere--everywhere within a few\\r\\nmiles--were a hundred thousand men, friends and enemies. Yet he was\\r\\nalone. The mist had isolated him as completely as if he had been in the\\r\\nheart of a desert. His world was a few square yards of wet and trampled\\r\\nearth about the feet of his horse. His comrades in that ghostly domain\\r\\nwere invisible and inaudible. These were conditions favorable to\\r\\nthought, and he was thinking. Of the nature of his thoughts his\\r\\nclear-cut handsome features yielded no attesting sign. His face was as\\r\\ninscrutable as that of the sphinx. Why should it have made a record\\r\\nwhich there was none to observe? At the sound of a footstep he merely\\r\\nturned his eyes in the direction whence it came; one of his sergeants,\\r\\nlooking a giant in stature in the false perspective of the fog,\\r\\napproached, and when clearly defined and reduced to his true dimensions\\r\\nby propinquity, saluted and stood at attention.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, Morris,\" said the officer, returning his subordinate\\'s salute.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Lieutenant Price directed me to tell you, sir, that most of the\\r\\ninfantry has been withdrawn. We have not sufficient support.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, I know.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am to say that some of our men have been out over the works a hundred\\r\\nyards and report that our front is not picketed.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"They were so far forward that they heard the enemy.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"They heard the rattle of the wheels of artillery and the commands of\\r\\nofficers.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The enemy is moving toward our works.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nCaptain Ransome, who had been facing to the rear of his line--toward the\\r\\npoint where the brigade commander and his cavalcade had been swallowed\\r\\nup by the fog--reined his horse about and faced the other way. Then he\\r\\nsat motionless as before.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Who are the men who made that statement?\" he inquired, without looking\\r\\nat the sergeant; his eyes were directed straight into the fog over the\\r\\nhead of his horse.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Corporal Hassman and Gunner Manning.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nCaptain Ransome was a moment silent. A slight pallor came into his face,\\r\\na slight compression affected the lines of his lips, but it would have\\r\\nrequired a closer observer than Sergeant Morris to note the change.\\r\\nThere was none in the voice.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Sergeant, present my compliments to Lieutenant Price and direct him to\\r\\nopen fire with all the guns. Grape.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe sergeant saluted and vanished in the fog.\\r\\n\\r\\nIV.\\r\\n\\r\\nTO INTRODUCE GENERAL MASTERSON\\r\\n\\r\\nSearching for his division commander,\\r\\nGeneral Cameron and his escort had followed the line of battle for\\r\\nnearly a mile to the right of Ransome\\'s battery, and there learned that\\r\\nthe division commander had gone in search of the corps commander. It\\r\\nseemed that everybody was looking for his immediate superior--an ominous\\r\\ncircumstance. It meant that nobody was quite at ease. So General Cameron\\r\\nrode on for another half-mile, where by good luck he met General\\r\\nMasterson, the division commander, returning.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ah, Cameron,\" said the higher officer, reining up, and throwing his\\r\\nright leg across the pommel of his saddle in a most unmilitary way--\\r\\n\"anything up? Found a good position for your battery, I hope--if one\\r\\nplace is better than another in a fog.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, general,\" said the other, with the greater dignity appropriate to\\r\\nhis less exalted rank, \"my battery is very well placed. I wish I could\\r\\nsay that it is as well commanded.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Eh, what\\'s that? Ransome? I think him a fine fellow. In the army we\\r\\nshould be proud of him.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was customary for officers of the regular army to speak of it as \"the\\r\\narmy.\" As the greatest cities are most provincial, so the\\r\\nself-complacency of aristocracies is most frankly plebeian.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He is too fond of his opinion. By the way, in order to occupy the hill\\r\\nthat he holds I had to extend my line dangerously. The hill is on my\\r\\nleft--that is to say the left flank of the army.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, no, Hart\\'s brigade is beyond. It was ordered up from Drytown during\\r\\nthe night and directed to hook on to you. Better go and--\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe sentence was unfinished: a lively cannonade had broken out on the\\r\\nleft, and both officers, followed by their retinues of aides and\\r\\norderlies making a great jingle and clank, rode rapidly toward the spot.\\r\\nBut they were soon impeded, for they were compelled by the fog to keep\\r\\nwithin sight of the line-of-battle, behind which were swarms of men, all\\r\\nin motion across their way. Everywhere the line was assuming a sharper\\r\\nand harder definition, as the men sprang to arms and the officers, with\\r\\ndrawn swords, \"dressed\" the ranks. Color-bearers unfurled the flags,\\r\\nbuglers blew the \"assembly,\" hospital attendants appeared with\\r\\nstretchers. Field officers mounted and sent their impedimenta to the\\r\\nrear in care of negro servants. Back in the ghostly spaces of the forest\\r\\ncould be heard the rustle and murmur of the reserves, pulling themselves\\r\\ntogether.\\r\\n\\r\\nNor was all this preparation vain, for scarcely five minutes had passed\\r\\nsince Captain Ransome\\'s guns had broken the truce of doubt before the\\r\\nwhole region was aroar: the enemy had attacked nearly everywhere.\\r\\n\\r\\nV\\r\\n\\r\\nHOW SOUNDS CAN FIGHT SHADOWS\\r\\n\\r\\nCaptain Ransome walked up and down behind his guns, which were firing\\r\\nrapidly but with steadiness. The gunners worked alertly, but without\\r\\nhaste or apparent excitement. There was really no reason for excitement;\\r\\nit is not much to point a cannon into a fog and fire it. Anybody can do\\r\\nas much as that.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe men smiled at their noisy work, performing it with a lessening\\r\\nalacrity. They cast curious regards upon their captain, who had now\\r\\nmounted the banquette of the fortification and was looking across the\\r\\nparapet as if observing the effect of his fire. But the only visible\\r\\neffect was the substitution of wide, low-lying sheets of smoke for their\\r\\nbulk of fog. Suddenly out of the obscurity burst a great sound of\\r\\ncheering, which filled the intervals between the reports of the guns\\r\\nwith startling distinctness! To the few with leisure and opportunity to\\r\\nobserve, the sound was inexpressibly strange--so loud, so near, so\\r\\nmenacing, yet nothing seen! The men who had smiled at their work smiled\\r\\nno more, but performed it with a serious and feverish activity.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom his station at the parapet Captain Ransome now saw a great\\r\\nmultitude of dim gray figures taking shape in the mist below him and\\r\\nswarming up the slope. But the work of the guns was now fast and\\r\\nfurious. They swept the populous declivity with gusts of grape and\\r\\ncanister, the whirring of which could be heard through the thunder of\\r\\nthe explosions. In this awful tempest of iron the assailants struggled\\r\\nforward foot by foot across their dead, firing into the embrasures,\\r\\nreloading, firing again, and at last falling in their turn, a little in\\r\\nadvance of those who had fallen before. Soon the smoke was dense enough\\r\\nto cover all. It settled down upon the attack and, drifting back,\\r\\ninvolved the defense. The gunners could hardly see to serve their\\r\\npieces, and when occasional figures of the enemy appeared upon the\\r\\nparapet--having had the good luck to get near enough to it, between two\\r\\nembrasures, to be protected from the guns--they looked so unsubstantial\\r\\nthat it seemed hardly worth while for the few infantrymen to go to work\\r\\nupon them with the bayonet and tumble them back into the ditch.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs the commander of a battery in action can find something better to do\\r\\nthan cracking individual skulls, Captain Ransome had retired from the\\r\\nparapet to his proper post in rear of his guns, where he stood with\\r\\nfolded arms, his bugler beside him. Here, during the hottest of the\\r\\nfight, he was approached by Lieutenant Price, who had just sabred a\\r\\ndaring assailant inside the work. A spirited colloquy ensued between the\\r\\ntwo officers--spirited, at least, on the part of the lieutenant, who\\r\\ngesticulated with energy and shouted again and again into his\\r\\ncommander\\'s ear in the attempt to make himself heard above the infernal\\r\\ndin of the guns. His gestures, if coolly noted by an actor, would have\\r\\nbeen pronounced to be those of protestation: one would have said that he\\r\\nwas opposed to the proceedings. Did he wish to surrender?\\r\\n\\r\\nCaptain Ransome listened without a change of countenance or attitude,\\r\\nand when the other man had finished his harangue, looked him coldly in\\r\\nthe eyes and during a seasonable abatement of the uproar said:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Lieutenant Price, it is not permitted to you to know _anything_. It is\\r\\nsufficient that you obey my orders.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe lieutenant went to his post, and the parapet being now apparently\\r\\nclear Captain Ransome returned to it to have a look over. As he mounted\\r\\nthe banquette a man sprang upon the crest, waving a great brilliant\\r\\nflag. The captain drew a pistol from his belt and shot him dead. The\\r\\nbody, pitching forward, hung over the inner edge of the embankment, the\\r\\narms straight downward, both hands still grasping the flag. The man\\'s\\r\\nfew followers turned and fled down the slope. Looking over the parapet,\\r\\nthe captain saw no living thing. He observed also that no bullets were\\r\\ncoming into the work.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe made a sign to the bugler, who sounded the command to cease firing.\\r\\nAt all other points the action had already ended with a repulse of the\\r\\nConfederate attack; with the cessation of this cannonade the silence was\\r\\nabsolute.\\r\\n\\r\\nVI\\r\\n\\r\\nWHY, BEING AFFRONTED BY A, IT IS NOT BEST TO AFFRONT B\\r\\n\\r\\nGeneral Masterson rode into the redoubt. The men, gathered in groups,\\r\\nwere talking loudly and gesticulating. They pointed at the dead, running\\r\\nfrom one body to another. They neglected their foul and heated guns and\\r\\nforgot to resume their outer clothing. They ran to the parapet and\\r\\nlooked over, some of them leaping down into the ditch. A score were\\r\\ngathered about a flag rigidly held by a dead man.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, my men,\" said the general cheerily, \"you have had a pretty fight\\r\\nof it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThey stared; nobody replied; the presence of the great man seemed to\\r\\nembarrass and alarm.\\r\\n\\r\\nGetting no response to his pleasant condescension, the easy-mannered\\r\\nofficer whistled a bar or two of a popular air, and riding forward to\\r\\nthe parapet, looked over at the dead. In an instant he had whirled his\\r\\nhorse about and was spurring along in rear of the guns, his eyes\\r\\neverywhere at once. An officer sat on the trail of one of the guns,\\r\\nsmoking a cigar. As the general dashed up he rose and tranquilly\\r\\nsaluted.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Captain Ransome!\"--the words fell sharp and harsh, like the clash of\\r\\nsteel blades--\"you have been fighting our own men--our own men, sir; do\\r\\nyou hear? Hart\\'s brigade!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"General, I know that.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You know it--you know that, and you sit here smoking? Oh, damn it,\\r\\nHamilton, I\\'m losing my temper,\"--this to his provost-marshal. \"Sir--\\r\\nCaptain Ransome, be good enough to say--to say why you fought our own\\r\\nmen.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That I am unable to say. In my orders that information was withheld.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nApparently the general did not comprehend.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Who was the aggressor in this affair, you or General Hart?\" he asked.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I was.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And could you not have known--could you not see, sir, that you were\\r\\nattacking our own men?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe reply was astounding!\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I knew that, general. It appeared to be none of my business.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThen, breaking the dead silence that followed his answer, he said:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I must refer you to General Cameron.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"General Cameron is dead, sir--as dead as he can be--as dead as any man\\r\\nin this army. He lies back yonder under a tree. Do you mean to say that\\r\\nhe had anything to do with this horrible business?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nCaptain Ransome did not reply. Observing the altercation his men had\\r\\ngathered about to watch the outcome. They were greatly excited. The fog,\\r\\nwhich had been partly dissipated by the firing, had again closed in so\\r\\ndarkly about them that they drew more closely together till the judge on\\r\\nhorseback and the accused standing calmly before him had but a narrow\\r\\nspace free from intrusion. It was the most informal of courts-martial,\\r\\nbut all felt that the formal one to follow would but affirm its\\r\\njudgment. It had no jurisdiction, but it had the significance of\\r\\nprophecy.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Captain Ransome,\" the general cried impetuously, but with something in\\r\\nhis voice that was almost entreaty, \"if you can say anything to put a\\r\\nbetter light upon your incomprehensible conduct I beg you will do so.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHaving recovered his temper this generous soldier sought for something\\r\\nto justify his naturally sympathetic attitude toward a brave man in the\\r\\nimminence of a dishonorable death.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Where is Lieutenant Price?\" the captain said.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat officer stood forward, his dark saturnine face looking somewhat\\r\\nforbidding under a bloody handkerchief bound about his brow. He\\r\\nunderstood the summons and needed no invitation to speak. He did not\\r\\nlook at the captain, but addressed the general:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"During the engagement I discovered the state of affairs, and apprised\\r\\nthe commander of the battery. I ventured to urge that the firing cease.\\r\\nI was insulted and ordered to my post.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Do you know anything of the orders under which I was acting?\" asked the\\r\\ncaptain.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Of any orders under which the commander of the battery was acting,\" the\\r\\nlieutenant continued, still addressing the general, \"I know nothing.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nCaptain Ransome felt his world sink away from his feet. In those cruel\\r\\nwords he heard the murmur of the centuries breaking upon the shore of\\r\\neternity. He heard the voice of doom; it said, in cold, mechanical, and\\r\\nmeasured tones: \"Ready, aim, fire!\" and he felt the bullets tear his\\r\\nheart to shreds. He heard the sound of the earth upon his coffin and (if\\r\\nthe good God was so merciful) the song of a bird above his forgotten\\r\\ngrave. Quietly detaching his sabre from its supports, he handed it up to\\r\\nthe provost-marshal.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nONE OFFICER, ONE MAN\\r\\n\\r\\nCaptain Graffenreid stood at the head of his company. The regiment was\\r\\nnot engaged. It formed a part of the front line-of-battle, which\\r\\nstretched away to the right with a visible length of nearly two miles\\r\\nthrough the open ground. The left flank was veiled by woods; to the\\r\\nright also the line was lost to sight, but it extended many miles. A\\r\\nhundred yards in rear was a second line; behind this, the reserve\\r\\nbrigades and divisions in column. Batteries of artillery occupied the\\r\\nspaces between and crowned the low hills. Groups of horsemen--generals\\r\\nwith their staffs and escorts, and field officers of regiments behind\\r\\nthe colors--broke the regularity of the lines and columns. Numbers of\\r\\nthese figures of interest had field-glasses at their eyes and sat\\r\\nmotionless, stolidly scanning the country in front; others came\\r\\nand went at a slow canter, bearing orders. There were squads of\\r\\nstretcher-bearers, ambulances, wagon-trains with ammunition, and\\r\\nofficers\\' servants in rear of all--of all that was visible--for still in\\r\\nrear of these, along the roads, extended for many miles all that vast\\r\\nmultitude of non-combatants who with their various _impedimenta_ are\\r\\nassigned to the inglorious but important duty of supplying the fighters\\'\\r\\nmany needs.\\r\\n\\r\\nAn army in line-of-battle awaiting attack, or prepared to deliver it,\\r\\npresents strange contrasts. At the front are precision, formality,\\r\\nfixity, and silence. Toward the rear these characteristics are less and\\r\\nless conspicuous, and finally, in point of space, are lost altogether in\\r\\nconfusion, motion and noise. The homogeneous becomes heterogeneous.\\r\\nDefinition is lacking; repose is replaced by an apparently purposeless\\r\\nactivity; harmony vanishes in hubbub, form in disorder. Commotion\\r\\neverywhere and ceaseless unrest. The men who do not fight are never\\r\\nready.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom his position at the right of his company in the front rank, Captain\\r\\nGraffenreid had an unobstructed outlook toward the enemy. A half-mile of\\r\\nopen and nearly level ground lay before him, and beyond it an irregular\\r\\nwood, covering a slight acclivity; not a human being anywhere visible.\\r\\nHe could imagine nothing more peaceful than the appearance of that\\r\\npleasant landscape with its long stretches of brown fields over which\\r\\nthe atmosphere was beginning to quiver in the heat of the morning sun.\\r\\nNot a sound came from forest or field--not even the barking of a dog or\\r\\nthe crowing of a cock at the half-seen plantation house on the crest\\r\\namong the trees. Yet every man in those miles of men knew that he and\\r\\ndeath were face to face.\\r\\n\\r\\nCaptain Graffenreid had never in his life seen an armed enemy, and the\\r\\nwar in which his regiment was one of the first to take the field was two\\r\\nyears old. He had had the rare advantage of a military education, and\\r\\nwhen his comrades had marched to the front he had been detached for\\r\\nadministrative service at the capital of his State, where it was thought\\r\\nthat he could be most useful. Like a bad soldier he protested, and like\\r\\na good one obeyed. In close official and personal relations with the\\r\\ngovernor of his State, and enjoying his confidence and favor, he had\\r\\nfirmly refused promotion and seen his juniors elevated above him. Death\\r\\nhad been busy in his distant regiment; vacancies among the field\\r\\nofficers had occurred again and again; but from a chivalrous feeling\\r\\nthat war\\'s rewards belonged of right to those who bore the storm and\\r\\nstress of battle he had held his humble rank and generously advanced the\\r\\nfortunes of others. His silent devotion to principle had conquered at\\r\\nlast: he had been relieved of his hateful duties and ordered to the\\r\\nfront, and now, untried by fire, stood in the van of battle in command\\r\\nof a company of hardy veterans, to whom he had been only a name, and\\r\\nthat name a by-word. By none--not even by those of his brother officers\\r\\nin whose favor he had waived his rights--was his devotion to duty\\r\\nunderstood. They were too busy to be just; he was looked upon as one who\\r\\nhad shirked his duty, until forced unwillingly into the field. Too proud\\r\\nto explain, yet not too insensible to feel, he could only endure and\\r\\nhope.\\r\\n\\r\\nOf all the Federal Army on that summer morning none had accepted battle\\r\\nmore joyously than Anderton Graffenreid. His spirit was buoyant, his\\r\\nfaculties were riotous. He was in a state of mental exaltation and\\r\\nscarcely could endure the enemy\\'s tardiness in advancing to the attack.\\r\\nTo him this was opportunity--for the result he cared nothing. Victory or\\r\\ndefeat, as God might will; in one or in the other he should prove\\r\\nhimself a soldier and a hero; he should vindicate his right to the\\r\\nrespect of his men and the companionship of his brother officers--to the\\r\\nconsideration of his superiors. How his heart leaped in his breast as\\r\\nthe bugle sounded the stirring notes of the \"assembly\"! With what a\\r\\nlight tread, scarcely conscious of the earth beneath his feet, he strode\\r\\nforward at the head of his company, and how exultingly he noted the\\r\\ntactical dispositions which placed his regiment in the front line! And\\r\\nif perchance some memory came to him of a pair of dark eyes that might\\r\\ntake on a tenderer light in reading the account of that day\\'s doings,\\r\\nwho shall blame him for the unmartial thought or count it a debasement\\r\\nof soldierly ardor?\\r\\n\\r\\nSuddenly, from the forest a half-mile in front--apparently from among\\r\\nthe upper branches of the trees, but really from the ridge beyond--rose\\r\\na tall column of white smoke. A moment later came a deep, jarring\\r\\nexplosion, followed--almost attended--by a hideous rushing sound that\\r\\nseemed to leap forward across the intervening space with inconceivable\\r\\nrapidity, rising from whisper to roar with too quick a gradation for\\r\\nattention to note the successive stages of its horrible progression! A\\r\\nvisible tremor ran along the lines of men; all were startled into\\r\\nmotion. Captain Graffenreid dodged and threw up his hands to one side of\\r\\nhis head, palms outward.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs he did so he heard a keen, ringing report, and saw on a hillside\\r\\nbehind the line a fierce roll of smoke and dust--the shell\\'s explosion.\\r\\nIt had passed a hundred feet to his left! He heard, or fancied he heard,\\r\\na low, mocking laugh and turning in the direction whence it came saw the\\r\\neyes of his first lieutenant fixed upon him with an unmistakable look of\\r\\namusement. He looked along the line of faces in the front ranks. The men\\r\\nwere laughing. At him? The thought restored the color to his bloodless\\r\\nface--restored too much of it. His cheeks burned with a fever of shame.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe enemy\\'s shot was not answered: the officer in command at that\\r\\nexposed part of the line had evidently no desire to provoke a cannonade.\\r\\nFor the forbearance Captain Graffenreid was conscious of a sense of\\r\\ngratitude. He had not known that the flight of a projectile was a\\r\\nphenomenon of so appalling character. His conception of war had already\\r\\nundergone a profound change, and he was conscious that his new feeling\\r\\nwas manifesting itself in visible perturbation. His blood was boiling in\\r\\nhis veins; he had a choking sensation and felt that if he had a command\\r\\nto give it would be inaudible, or at least unintelligible. The hand in\\r\\nwhich he held his sword trembled; the other moved automatically,\\r\\nclutching at various parts of his clothing. He found a difficulty in\\r\\nstanding still and fancied that his men observed it. Was it fear? He\\r\\nfeared it was.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom somewhere away to the right came, as the wind served, a low,\\r\\nintermittent murmur like that of ocean in a storm--like that of a\\r\\ndistant railway train--like that of wind among the pines--three sounds\\r\\nso nearly alike that the ear, unaided by the judgment, cannot\\r\\ndistinguish them one from another. The eyes of the troops were drawn in\\r\\nthat direction; the mounted officers turned their field-glasses that\\r\\nway. Mingled with the sound was an irregular throbbing. He thought it,\\r\\nat first, the beating of his fevered blood in his ears; next, the\\r\\ndistant tapping of a bass drum.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The ball is opened on the right flank,\" said an officer.\\r\\n\\r\\nCaptain Graffenreid understood: the sounds were musketry and artillery.\\r\\nHe nodded and tried to smile. There was apparently nothing infectious in\\r\\nthe smile.\\r\\n\\r\\nPresently a light line of blue smoke-puffs broke out along the edge of\\r\\nthe wood in front, succeeded by a crackle of rifles. There were keen,\\r\\nsharp hissings in the air, terminating abruptly with a thump near by.\\r\\nThe man at Captain Graffenreid\\'s side dropped his rifle; his knees gave\\r\\nway and he pitched awkwardly forward, falling upon his face. Somebody\\r\\nshouted \"Lie down!\" and the dead man was hardly distinguishable from the\\r\\nliving. It looked as if those few rifle-shots had slain ten thousand\\r\\nmen. Only the field officers remained erect; their concession to the\\r\\nemergency consisted in dismounting and sending their horses to the\\r\\nshelter of the low hills immediately in rear.\\r\\n\\r\\nCaptain Graffenreid lay alongside the dead man, from beneath whose\\r\\nbreast flowed a little rill of blood. It had a faint, sweetish odor that\\r\\nsickened him. The face was crushed into the earth and flattened. It\\r\\nlooked yellow already, and was repulsive. Nothing suggested the glory of\\r\\na soldier\\'s death nor mitigated the loathsomeness of the incident. He\\r\\ncould not turn his back upon the body without facing away from his\\r\\ncompany.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe fixed his eyes upon the forest, where all again was silent. He tried\\r\\nto imagine what was going on there--the lines of troops forming to\\r\\nattack, the guns being pushed forward by hand to the edge of the open.\\r\\nHe fancied he could see their black muzzles protruding from the\\r\\nundergrowth, ready to deliver their storm of missiles--such missiles as\\r\\nthe one whose shriek had so unsettled his nerves. The distension of his\\r\\neyes became painful; a mist seemed to gather before them; he could no\\r\\nlonger see across the field, yet would not withdraw his gaze lest he see\\r\\nthe dead man at his side.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe fire of battle was not now burning very brightly in this warrior\\'s\\r\\nsoul. From inaction had come introspection. He sought rather to analyze\\r\\nhis feelings than distinguish himself by courage and devotion. The\\r\\nresult was profoundly disappointing. He covered his face with his hands\\r\\nand groaned aloud.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe hoarse murmur of battle grew more and more distinct upon the right;\\r\\nthe murmur had, indeed, become a roar, the throbbing, a thunder. The\\r\\nsounds had worked round obliquely to the front; evidently the enemy\\'s\\r\\nleft was being driven back, and the propitious moment to move against\\r\\nthe salient angle of his line would soon arrive. The silence and mystery\\r\\nin front were ominous; all felt that they boded evil to the assailants.\\r\\n\\r\\nBehind the prostrate lines sounded the hoofbeats of galloping horses;\\r\\nthe men turned to look. A dozen staff officers were riding to the\\r\\nvarious brigade and regimental commanders, who had remounted. A moment\\r\\nmore and there was a chorus of voices, all uttering out of time the same\\r\\nwords--\"Attention, battalion!\" The men sprang to their feet and were\\r\\naligned by the company commanders. They awaited the word \"forward\"--\\r\\nawaited, too, with beating hearts and set teeth the gusts of lead and\\r\\niron that were to smite them at their first movement in obedience to\\r\\nthat word. The word was not given; the tempest did not break out. The\\r\\ndelay was hideous, maddening! It unnerved like a respite at the\\r\\nguillotine.\\r\\n\\r\\nCaptain Graffenreid stood at the head of his company, the dead man at\\r\\nhis feet. He heard the battle on the right--rattle and crash of\\r\\nmusketry, ceaseless thunder of cannon, desultory cheers of invisible\\r\\ncombatants. He marked ascending clouds of smoke from distant forests. He\\r\\nnoted the sinister silence of the forest in front. These contrasting\\r\\nextremes affected the whole range of his sensibilities. The strain upon\\r\\nhis nervous organization was insupportable. He grew hot and cold by\\r\\nturns. He panted like a dog, and then forgot to breathe until reminded\\r\\nby vertigo.\\r\\n\\r\\nSuddenly he grew calm. Glancing downward, his eyes had fallen upon his\\r\\nnaked sword, as he held it, point to earth. Foreshortened to his view,\\r\\nit resembled somewhat, he thought, the short heavy blade of the ancient\\r\\nRoman. The fancy was full of suggestion, malign, fateful, heroic!\\r\\n\\r\\nThe sergeant in the rear rank, immediately behind Captain Graffenreid,\\r\\nnow observed a strange sight. His attention drawn by an uncommon\\r\\nmovement made by the captain--a sudden reaching forward of the hands and\\r\\ntheir energetic withdrawal, throwing the elbows out, as in pulling an\\r\\noar--he saw spring from between the officer\\'s shoulders a bright point\\r\\nof metal which prolonged itself outward, nearly a half-arm\\'s length--a\\r\\nblade! It was faintly streaked with crimson, and its point approached so\\r\\nnear to the sergeant\\'s breast, and with so quick a movement, that he\\r\\nshrank backward in alarm. That moment Captain Graffenreid pitched\\r\\nheavily forward upon the dead man and died.\\r\\n\\r\\nA week later the major-general commanding the left corps of the Federal\\r\\nArmy submitted the following official report:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"SIR: I have the honor to report, with regard to the action of the 19th\\r\\ninst, that owing to the enemy\\'s withdrawal from my front to reinforce\\r\\nhis beaten left, my command was not seriously engaged. My loss was as\\r\\nfollows: Killed, one officer, one man.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nGEORGE THURSTON\\r\\n\\r\\nTHREE INCIDENTS IN THE LIFE OF A MAN\\r\\n\\r\\nGeorge Thurston was a first lieutenant and aide-de-camp on the staff of\\r\\nColonel Brough, commanding a Federal brigade. Colonel Brough was only\\r\\ntemporarily in command, as senior colonel, the brigadier-general having\\r\\nbeen severely wounded and granted a leave of absence to recover.\\r\\nLieutenant Thurston was, I believe, of Colonel Brough\\'s regiment, to\\r\\nwhich, with his chief, he would naturally have been relegated had he\\r\\nlived till our brigade commander\\'s recovery. The aide whose place\\r\\nThurston took had been killed in battle; Thurston\\'s advent among us was\\r\\nthe only change in the _personnel_ of our staff consequent upon the\\r\\nchange in commanders. We did not like him; he was unsocial. This,\\r\\nhowever, was more observed by others than by me. Whether in camp or on\\r\\nthe march, in barracks, in tents, or _en bivouac_, my duties as\\r\\ntopographical engineer kept me working like a beaver--all day in the\\r\\nsaddle and half the night at my drawing-table, platting my surveys. It\\r\\nwas hazardous work; the nearer to the enemy\\'s lines I could penetrate,\\r\\nthe more valuable were my field notes and the resulting maps. It was a\\r\\nbusiness in which the lives of men counted as nothing against the chance\\r\\nof defining a road or sketching a bridge. Whole squadrons of cavalry\\r\\nescort had sometimes to be sent thundering against a powerful infantry\\r\\noutpost in order that the brief time between the charge and the\\r\\ninevitable retreat might be utilized in sounding a ford or determining\\r\\nthe point of intersection of two roads.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn some of the dark corners of England and Wales they have an immemorial\\r\\ncustom of \"beating the bounds\" of the parish. On a certain day of the\\r\\nyear the whole population turns out and travels in procession from one\\r\\nlandmark to another on the boundary line. At the most important points\\r\\nlads are soundly beaten with rods to make them remember the place in\\r\\nafter life. They become authorities. Our frequent engagements with the\\r\\nConfederate outposts, patrols, and scouting parties had, incidentally,\\r\\nthe same educating value; they fixed in my memory a vivid and apparently\\r\\nimperishable picture of the locality--a picture serving instead of\\r\\naccurate field notes, which, indeed, it was not always convenient to\\r\\ntake, with carbines cracking, sabers clashing, and horses plunging all\\r\\nabout. These spirited encounters were observations entered in red.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne morning as I set out at the head of my escort on an expedition of\\r\\nmore than the usual hazard Lieutenant Thurston rode up alongside and\\r\\nasked if I had any objection to his accompanying me, the colonel\\r\\ncommanding having given him permission.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"None whatever,\" I replied rather gruffly; \"but in what capacity will\\r\\nyou go? You are not a topographical engineer, and Captain Burling\\r\\ncommands my escort.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I will go as a spectator,\" he said. Removing his sword-belt and taking\\r\\nthe pistols from his holsters he handed them to his servant, who took\\r\\nthem back to headquarters. I realized the brutality of my remark, but\\r\\nnot clearly seeing my way to an apology, said nothing.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat afternoon we encountered a whole regiment of the enemy\\'s cavalry in\\r\\nline and a field-piece that dominated a straight mile of the turnpike by\\r\\nwhich we had approached. My escort fought deployed in the woods on both\\r\\nsides, but Thurston remained in the center of the road, which at\\r\\nintervals of a few seconds was swept by gusts of grape and canister that\\r\\ntore the air wide open as they passed. He had dropped the rein on the\\r\\nneck of his horse and sat bolt upright in the saddle, with folded arms.\\r\\nSoon he was down, his horse torn to pieces. From the side of the road,\\r\\nmy pencil and field book idle, my duty forgotten, I watched him slowly\\r\\ndisengaging himself from the wreck and rising. At that instant, the\\r\\ncannon having ceased firing, a burly Confederate trooper on a spirited\\r\\nhorse dashed like a thunderbolt down the road with drawn saber. Thurston\\r\\nsaw him coming, drew himself up to his full height, and again folded his\\r\\narms. He was too brave to retreat before the word, and my uncivil words\\r\\nhad disarmed him. He was a spectator. Another moment and he would have\\r\\nbeen split like a mackerel, but a blessed bullet tumbled his assailant\\r\\ninto the dusty road so near that the impetus sent the body rolling to\\r\\nThurston\\'s feet. That evening, while platting my hasty survey, I found\\r\\ntime to frame an apology, which I think took the rude, primitive form of\\r\\na confession that I had spoken like a malicious idiot.\\r\\n\\r\\nA few weeks later a part of our army made an assault upon the enemy\\'s\\r\\nleft. The attack, which was made upon an unknown position and across\\r\\nunfamiliar ground, was led by our brigade. The ground was so broken and\\r\\nthe underbrush so thick that all mounted officers and men were compelled\\r\\nto fight on foot--the brigade commander and his staff included. In the\\r\\n_m\\xc3\\xaal\\xc3\\xa9e_ Thurston was parted from the rest of us, and we found him,\\r\\nhorribly wounded, only when we had taken the enemy\\'s last defense. He\\r\\nwas some months in hospital at Nashville, Tennessee, but finally\\r\\nrejoined us. He said little about his misadventure, except that he had\\r\\nbeen bewildered and had strayed into the enemy\\'s lines and been shot\\r\\ndown; but from one of his captors, whom we in turn had captured, we\\r\\nlearned the particulars. \"He came walking right upon us as we lay in\\r\\nline,\" said this man. \"A whole company of us instantly sprang up and\\r\\nleveled our rifles at his breast, some of them almost touching him.\\r\\n\\'Throw down that sword and surrender, you damned Yank!\\' shouted some one\\r\\nin authority. The fellow ran his eyes along the line of rifle barrels,\\r\\nfolded his arms across his breast, his right hand still clutching his\\r\\nsword, and deliberately replied, \\'I will not.\\' If we had all fired he\\r\\nwould have been torn to shreds. Some of us didn\\'t. I didn\\'t, for one;\\r\\nnothing could have induced me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen one is tranquilly looking death in the eye and refusing him any\\r\\nconcession one naturally has a good opinion of one\\'s self. I don\\'t know\\r\\nif it was this feeling that in Thurston found expression in a stiffish\\r\\nattitude and folded arms; at the mess table one day, in his absence,\\r\\nanother explanation was suggested by our quartermaster, an irreclaimable\\r\\nstammerer when the wine was in: \"It\\'s h--is w--ay of m-m-mastering a\\r\\nc-c-consti-t-tu-tional t-tendency to r--un aw--ay.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What!\" I flamed out, indignantly rising; \"you intimate that Thurston is\\r\\na coward--and in his absence?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If he w--ere a cow--wow-ard h--e w--wouldn\\'t t-try to m-m-master it;\\r\\nand if he w--ere p-present I w--wouldn\\'t d-d-dare to d-d-discuss it,\"\\r\\nwas the mollifying reply.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis intrepid man, George Thurston, died an ignoble death. The brigade\\r\\nwas in camp, with headquarters in a grove of immense trees. To an upper\\r\\nbranch of one of these a venturesome climber had attached the two ends\\r\\nof a long rope and made a swing with a length of not less than one\\r\\nhundred feet. Plunging downward from a height of fifty feet, along the\\r\\narc of a circle with such a radius, soaring to an equal altitude,\\r\\npausing for one breathless instant, then sweeping dizzily backward--no\\r\\none who has not tried it can conceive the terrors of such sport to the\\r\\nnovice. Thurston came out of his tent one day and asked for instruction\\r\\nin the mystery of propelling the swing--the art of rising and sitting,\\r\\nwhich every boy has mastered. In a few moments he had acquired the trick\\r\\nand was swinging higher than the most experienced of us had dared. We\\r\\nshuddered to look at his fearful flights.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"St-t-top him,\" said the quartermaster, snailing lazily along from the\\r\\nmess-tent, where he had been lunching; \"h--e d-doesn\\'t know that if h--e\\r\\ng-g-goes c-clear over h--e\\'ll w--ind up the sw--ing.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWith such energy was that strong man cannonading himself through the air\\r\\nthat at each extremity of his increasing arc his body, standing in the\\r\\nswing, was almost horizontal. Should he once pass above the level of the\\r\\nrope\\'s attachment he would be lost; the rope would slacken and he would\\r\\nfall vertically to a point as far below as he had gone above, and then\\r\\nthe sudden tension of the rope would wrest it from his hands. All saw\\r\\nthe peril--all cried out to him to desist, and gesticulated at him as,\\r\\nindistinct and with a noise like the rush of a cannon shot in flight, he\\r\\nswept past us through the lower reaches of his hideous oscillation. A\\r\\nwoman standing at a little distance away fainted and fell unobserved.\\r\\nMen from the camp of a regiment near by ran in crowds to see, all\\r\\nshouting. Suddenly, as Thurston was on his upward curve, the shouts all\\r\\nceased.\\r\\n\\r\\nThurston and the swing had parted--that is all that can be known; both\\r\\nhands at once had released the rope. The impetus of the light swing\\r\\nexhausted, it was falling back; the man\\'s momentum was carrying him,\\r\\nalmost erect, upward and forward, no longer in his arc, but with an\\r\\noutward curve. It could have been but an instant, yet it seemed an age.\\r\\nI cried out, or thought I cried out: \"My God! will he never stop going\\r\\nup?\" He passed close to the branch of a tree. I remember a feeling of\\r\\ndelight as I thought he would clutch it and save himself. I speculated\\r\\non the possibility of it sustaining his weight. He passed above it, and\\r\\nfrom my point of view was sharply outlined against the blue. At this\\r\\ndistance of many years I can distinctly recall that image of a man in\\r\\nthe sky, its head erect, its feet close together, its hands--I do not\\r\\nsee its hands. All at once, with astonishing suddenness and rapidity, it\\r\\nturns clear over and pitches downward. There is another cry from the\\r\\ncrowd, which has rushed instinctively forward. The man has become merely\\r\\na whirling object, mostly legs. Then there is an indescribable sound--\\r\\nthe sound of an impact that shakes the earth, and these men, familiar\\r\\nwith death in its most awful aspects, turn sick. Many walk unsteadily\\r\\naway from the spot; others support themselves against the trunks of\\r\\ntrees or sit at the roots. Death has taken an unfair advantage; he has\\r\\nstruck with an unfamiliar weapon; he has executed a new and disquieting\\r\\nstratagem. We did not know that he had so ghastly resources,\\r\\npossibilities of terror so dismal.\\r\\n\\r\\nThurston\\'s body lay on its back. One leg, bent beneath, was broken above\\r\\nthe knee and the bone driven into the earth. The abdomen had burst; the\\r\\nbowels protruded. The neck was broken.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe arms were folded tightly across the breast.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE MOCKING-BIRD\\r\\n\\r\\nThe time, a pleasant Sunday afternoon in the early autumn of 1861. The\\r\\nplace, a forest\\'s heart in the mountain region of southwestern Virginia.\\r\\nPrivate Grayrock of the Federal Army is discovered seated comfortably at\\r\\nthe root of a great pine tree, against which he leans, his legs extended\\r\\nstraight along the ground, his rifle lying across his thighs, his hands\\r\\n(clasped in order that they may not fall away to his sides) resting upon\\r\\nthe barrel of the weapon. The contact of the back of his head with the\\r\\ntree has pushed his cap downward over his eyes, almost concealing them;\\r\\none seeing him would say that he slept.\\r\\n\\r\\nPrivate Grayrock did not sleep; to have done so would have imperiled the\\r\\ninterests of the United States, for he was a long way outside the lines\\r\\nand subject to capture or death at the hands of the enemy. Moreover, he\\r\\nwas in a frame of mind unfavorable to repose. The cause of his\\r\\nperturbation of spirit was this: during the previous night he had served\\r\\non the picket-guard, and had been posted as a sentinel in this very\\r\\nforest. The night was clear, though moonless, but in the gloom of the\\r\\nwood the darkness was deep. Grayrock\\'s post was at a considerable\\r\\ndistance from those to right and left, for the pickets had been thrown\\r\\nout a needless distance from the camp, making the line too long for the\\r\\nforce detailed to occupy it. The war was young, and military camps\\r\\nentertained the error that while sleeping they were better protected by\\r\\nthin lines a long way out toward the enemy than by thicker ones close\\r\\nin. And surely they needed as long notice as possible of an enemy\\'s\\r\\napproach, for they were at that time addicted to the practice of\\r\\nundressing--than which nothing could be more unsoldierly. On the morning\\r\\nof the memorable 6th of April, at Shiloh, many of Grant\\'s men when\\r\\nspitted on Confederate bayonets were as naked as civilians; but it\\r\\nshould be allowed that this was not because of any defect in their\\r\\npicket line. Their error was of another sort: they had no pickets. This\\r\\nis perhaps a vain digression. I should not care to undertake to interest\\r\\nthe reader in the fate of an army; what we have here to consider is that\\r\\nof Private Grayrock.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor two hours after he had been left at his lonely post that Saturday\\r\\nnight he stood stock-still, leaning against the trunk of a large tree,\\r\\nstaring into the darkness in his front and trying to recognize known\\r\\nobjects; for he had been posted at the same spot during the day. But all\\r\\nwas now different; he saw nothing in detail, but only groups of things,\\r\\nwhose shapes, not observed when there was something more of them to\\r\\nobserve, were now unfamiliar. They seemed not to have been there before.\\r\\nA landscape that is all trees and undergrowth, moreover, lacks\\r\\ndefinition, is confused and without accentuated points upon which\\r\\nattention can gain a foothold. Add the gloom of a moonless night, and\\r\\nsomething more than great natural intelligence and a city education is\\r\\nrequired to preserve one\\'s knowledge of direction. And that is how it\\r\\noccurred that Private Grayrock, after vigilantly watching the spaces in\\r\\nhis front and then imprudently executing a circumspection of his whole\\r\\ndimly visible environment (silently walking around his tree to\\r\\naccomplish it) lost his bearings and seriously impaired his usefulness\\r\\nas a sentinel. Lost at his post--unable to say in which direction to\\r\\nlook for an enemy\\'s approach, and in which lay the sleeping camp for\\r\\nwhose security he was accountable with his life--conscious, too, of many\\r\\nanother awkward feature of the situation and of considerations affecting\\r\\nhis own safety, Private Grayrock was profoundly disquieted. Nor was he\\r\\ngiven time to recover his tranquillity, for almost at the moment that he\\r\\nrealized his awkward predicament he heard a stir of leaves and a snap of\\r\\nfallen twigs, and turning with a stilled heart in the direction whence\\r\\nit came, saw in the gloom the indistinct outlines of a human figure.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Halt!\" shouted Private Grayrock, peremptorily as in duty bound, backing\\r\\nup the command with the sharp metallic snap of his cocking rifle--\"who\\r\\ngoes there?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was no answer; at least there was an instant\\'s hesitation, and the\\r\\nanswer, if it came, was lost in the report of the sentinel\\'s rifle. In\\r\\nthe silence of the night and the forest the sound was deafening, and\\r\\nhardly had it died away when it was repeated by the pieces of the\\r\\npickets to right and left, a sympathetic fusillade. For two hours every\\r\\nunconverted civilian of them had been evolving enemies from his\\r\\nimagination, and peopling the woods in his front with them, and\\r\\nGrayrock\\'s shot had started the whole encroaching host into visible\\r\\nexistence. Having fired, all retreated, breathless, to the reserves--all\\r\\nbut Grayrock, who did not know in what direction to retreat. When, no\\r\\nenemy appearing, the roused camp two miles away had undressed and got\\r\\nitself into bed again, and the picket line was cautiously\\r\\nre-established, he was discovered bravely holding his ground, and was\\r\\ncomplimented by the officer of the guard as the one soldier of that\\r\\ndevoted band who could rightly be considered the moral equivalent of\\r\\nthat uncommon unit of value, \"a whoop in hell.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the mean time, however, Grayrock had made a close but unavailing\\r\\nsearch for the mortal part of the intruder at whom he had fired, and\\r\\nwhom he had a marksman\\'s intuitive sense of having hit; for he was one\\r\\nof those born experts who shoot without aim by an instinctive sense of\\r\\ndirection, and are nearly as dangerous by night as by day. During a full\\r\\nhalf of his twenty-four years he had been a terror to the targets of all\\r\\nthe shooting-galleries in three cities. Unable now to produce his dead\\r\\ngame he had the discretion to hold his tongue, and was glad to observe\\r\\nin his officer and comrades the natural assumption that not having run\\r\\naway he had seen nothing hostile. His \"honorable mention\" had been\\r\\nearned by not running away anyhow.\\r\\n\\r\\nNevertheless, Private Grayrock was far from satisfied with the night\\'s\\r\\nadventure, and when the next day he made some fair enough pretext to\\r\\napply for a pass to go outside the lines, and the general commanding\\r\\npromptly granted it in recognition of his bravery the night before, he\\r\\npassed out at the point where that had been displayed. Telling the\\r\\nsentinel then on duty there that he had lost something,--which was true\\r\\nenough--he renewed the search for the person whom he supposed himself to\\r\\nhave shot, and whom if only wounded he hoped to trail by the blood. He\\r\\nwas no more successful by daylight than he had been in the darkness, and\\r\\nafter covering a wide area and boldly penetrating a long distance into\\r\\n\"the Confederacy\" he gave up the search, somewhat fatigued, seated\\r\\nhimself at the root of the great pine tree, where we have seen him, and\\r\\nindulged his disappointment.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is not to be inferred that Grayrock\\'s was the chagrin of a cruel\\r\\nnature balked of its bloody deed. In the clear large eyes, finely\\r\\nwrought lips, and broad forehead of that young man one could read quite\\r\\nanother story, and in point of fact his character was a singularly\\r\\nfelicitous compound of boldness and sensibility, courage and conscience.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I find myself disappointed,\" he said to himself, sitting there at the\\r\\nbottom of the golden haze submerging the forest like a subtler sea--\\r\\n\"disappointed in failing to discover a fellow-man dead by my hand! Do I\\r\\nthen really wish that I had taken life in the performance of a duty as\\r\\nwell performed without? What more could I wish? If any danger\\r\\nthreatened, my shot averted it; that is what I was there to do. No, I am\\r\\nglad indeed if no human life was needlessly extinguished by me. But I am\\r\\nin a false position. I have suffered myself to be complimented by my\\r\\nofficers and envied by my comrades. The camp is ringing with praise of\\r\\nmy courage. That is not just; I know myself courageous, but this praise\\r\\nis for specific acts which I did not perform, or performed--otherwise.\\r\\nIt is believed that I remained at my post bravely, without firing,\\r\\nwhereas it was I who began the fusillade, and I did not retreat in the\\r\\ngeneral alarm because bewildered. What, then, shall I do? Explain that I\\r\\nsaw an enemy and fired? They have all said that of themselves, yet none\\r\\nbelieves it. Shall I tell a truth which, discrediting my courage, will\\r\\nhave the effect of a lie? Ugh! it is an ugly business altogether. I wish\\r\\nto God I could find my man!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd so wishing, Private Grayrock, overcome at last by the languor of the\\r\\nafternoon and lulled by the stilly sounds of insects droning and prosing\\r\\nin certain fragrant shrubs, so far forgot the interests of the United\\r\\nStates as to fall asleep and expose himself to capture. And sleeping he\\r\\ndreamed.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe thought himself a boy, living in a far, fair land by the border of a\\r\\ngreat river upon which the tall steamboats moved grandly up and down\\r\\nbeneath their towering evolutions of black smoke, which announced them\\r\\nlong before they had rounded the bends and marked their movements when\\r\\nmiles out of sight. With him always, at his side as he watched them, was\\r\\none to whom he gave his heart and soul in love--a twin brother. Together\\r\\nthey strolled along the banks of the stream; together explored the\\r\\nfields lying farther away from it, and gathered pungent mints and sticks\\r\\nof fragrant sassafras in the hills overlooking all--beyond which lay the\\r\\nRealm of Conjecture, and from which, looking southward across the great\\r\\nriver, they caught glimpses of the Enchanted Land. Hand in hand and\\r\\nheart in heart they two, the only children of a widowed mother, walked\\r\\nin paths of light through valleys of peace, seeing new things under a\\r\\nnew sun. And through all the golden days floated one unceasing sound--\\r\\nthe rich, thrilling melody of a mocking-bird in a cage by the cottage\\r\\ndoor. It pervaded and possessed all the spiritual intervals of the\\r\\ndream, like a musical benediction. The joyous bird was always in song;\\r\\nits infinitely various notes seemed to flow from its throat, effortless,\\r\\nin bubbles and rills at each heart-beat, like the waters of a pulsing\\r\\nspring. That fresh, clear melody seemed, indeed, the spirit of the\\r\\nscene, the meaning and interpretation to sense of the mysteries of life\\r\\nand love.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut there came a time when the days of the dream grew dark with sorrow\\r\\nin a rain of tears. The good mother was dead, the meadowside home by the\\r\\ngreat river was broken up, and the brothers were parted between two of\\r\\ntheir kinsmen. William (the dreamer) went to live in a populous city in\\r\\nthe Realm of Conjecture, and John, crossing the river into the Enchanted\\r\\nLand, was taken to a distant region whose people in their lives and ways\\r\\nwere said to be strange and wicked. To him, in the distribution of the\\r\\ndead mother\\'s estate, had fallen all that they deemed of value--the\\r\\nmocking-bird. They could be divided, but it could not, so it was carried\\r\\naway into the strange country, and the world of William knew it no more\\r\\nforever. Yet still through the aftertime of his loneliness its song\\r\\nfilled all the dream, and seemed always sounding in his ear and in his\\r\\nheart.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe kinsmen who had adopted the boys were enemies, holding no\\r\\ncommunication. For a time letters full of boyish bravado and boastful\\r\\nnarratives of the new and larger experience--grotesque descriptions of\\r\\ntheir widening lives and the new worlds they had conquered--passed\\r\\nbetween them; but these gradually became less frequent, and with\\r\\nWilliam\\'s removal to another and greater city ceased altogether. But\\r\\never through it all ran the song of the mocking-bird, and when the\\r\\ndreamer opened his eyes and stared through the vistas of the pine forest\\r\\nthe cessation of its music first apprised him that he was awake.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe sun was low and red in the west; the level rays projected from the\\r\\ntrunk of each giant pine a wall of shadow traversing the golden haze to\\r\\neastward until light and shade were blended in undistinguishable blue.\\r\\n\\r\\nPrivate Grayrock rose to his feet, looked cautiously about him,\\r\\nshouldered his rifle and set off toward camp. He had gone perhaps a\\r\\nhalf-mile, and was passing a thicket of laurel, when a bird rose from\\r\\nthe midst of it and perching on the branch of a tree above, poured from\\r\\nits joyous breast so inexhaustible floods of song as but one of all\\r\\nGod\\'s creatures can utter in His praise. There was little in that--it\\r\\nwas only to open the bill and breathe; yet the man stopped as if struck\\r\\n--stopped and let fall his rifle, looked upward at the bird, covered his\\r\\neyes with his hands and wept like a child! For the moment he was,\\r\\nindeed, a child, in spirit and in memory, dwelling again by the great\\r\\nriver, over-against the Enchanted Land! Then with an effort of the will\\r\\nhe pulled himself together, picked up his weapon and audibly damning\\r\\nhimself for an idiot strode on. Passing an opening that reached into the\\r\\nheart of the little thicket he looked in, and there, supine upon the\\r\\nearth, its arms all abroad, its gray uniform stained with a single spot\\r\\nof blood upon the breast, its white face turned sharply upward and\\r\\nbackward, lay the image of himself!--the body of John Grayrock, dead of\\r\\na gunshot wound, and still warm! He had found his man.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs the unfortunate soldier knelt beside that masterwork of civil war the\\r\\nshrilling bird upon the bough overhead stilled her song and, flushed\\r\\nwith sunset\\'s crimson glory, glided silently away through the solemn\\r\\nspaces of the wood. At roll-call that evening in the Federal camp the\\r\\nname William Grayrock brought no response, nor ever again there-after.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCIVILIANS\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE MAN OUT OF THE NOSE\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the intersection of two certain streets in that part of San Francisco\\r\\nknown by the rather loosely applied name of North Beach, is a vacant\\r\\nlot, which is rather more nearly level than is usually the case with\\r\\nlots, vacant or otherwise, in that region. Immediately at the back of\\r\\nit, to the south, however, the ground slopes steeply upward, the\\r\\nacclivity broken by three terraces cut into the soft rock. It is a place\\r\\nfor goats and poor persons, several families of each class having\\r\\noccupied it jointly and amicably \"from the foundation of the city.\" One\\r\\nof the humble habitations of the lowest terrace is noticeable for its\\r\\nrude resemblance to the human face, or rather to such a simulacrum of it\\r\\nas a boy might cut out of a hollowed pumpkin, meaning no offense to his\\r\\nrace. The eyes are two circular windows, the nose is a door, the mouth\\r\\nan aperture caused by removal of a board below. There are no doorsteps.\\r\\nAs a face, this house is too large; as a dwelling, too small. The blank,\\r\\nunmeaning stare of its lidless and browless eyes is uncanny.\\r\\n\\r\\nSometimes a man steps out of the nose, turns, passes the place where the\\r\\nright ear should be and making his way through the throng of children\\r\\nand goats obstructing the narrow walk between his neighbors\\' doors and\\r\\nthe edge of the terrace gains the street by descending a flight of\\r\\nrickety stairs. Here he pauses to consult his watch and the stranger who\\r\\nhappens to pass wonders why such a man as that can care what is the\\r\\nhour. Longer observations would show that the time of day is an\\r\\nimportant element in the man\\'s movements, for it is at precisely two\\r\\no\\'clock in the afternoon that he comes forth 365 times in every year.\\r\\n\\r\\nHaving satisfied himself that he has made no mistake in the hour he\\r\\nreplaces the watch and walks rapidly southward up the street two\\r\\nsquares, turns to the right and as he approaches the next corner fixes\\r\\nhis eyes on an upper window in a three-story building across the way.\\r\\nThis is a somewhat dingy structure, originally of red brick and now\\r\\ngray. It shows the touch of age and dust. Built for a dwelling, it is\\r\\nnow a factory. I do not know what is made there; the things that are\\r\\ncommonly made in a factory, I suppose. I only know that at two o\\'clock\\r\\nin the afternoon of every day but Sunday it is full of activity and\\r\\nclatter; pulsations of some great engine shake it and there are\\r\\nrecurrent screams of wood tormented by the saw. At the window on which\\r\\nthe man fixes an intensely expectant gaze nothing ever appears; the\\r\\nglass, in truth, has such a coating of dust that it has long ceased to\\r\\nbe transparent. The man looks at it without stopping; he merely keeps\\r\\nturning his head more and more backward as he leaves the building\\r\\nbehind. Passing along to the next corner, he turns to the left, goes\\r\\nround the block, and comes back till he reaches the point diagonally\\r\\nacross the street from the factory--point on his former course, which he\\r\\nthen retraces, looking frequently backward over his right shoulder at\\r\\nthe window while it is in sight. For many years he has not been known to\\r\\nvary his route nor to introduce a single innovation into his action. In\\r\\na quarter of an hour he is again at the mouth of his dwelling, and a\\r\\nwoman, who has for some time been standing in the nose, assists him to\\r\\nenter. He is seen no more until two o\\'clock the next day. The woman is\\r\\nhis wife. She supports herself and him by washing for the poor people\\r\\namong whom they live, at rates which destroy Chinese and domestic\\r\\ncompetition.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis man is about fifty-seven years of age, though he looks greatly\\r\\nolder. His hair is dead white. He wears no beard, and is always newly\\r\\nshaven. His hands are clean, his nails well kept. In the matter of dress\\r\\nhe is distinctly superior to his position, as indicated by his\\r\\nsurroundings and the business of his wife. He is, indeed, very neatly,\\r\\nif not quite fashionably, clad. His silk hat has a date no earlier than\\r\\nthe year before the last, and his boots, scrupulously polished, are\\r\\ninnocent of patches. I am told that the suit which he wears during his\\r\\ndaily excursions of fifteen minutes is not the one that he wears at\\r\\nhome. Like everything else that he has, this is provided and kept in\\r\\nrepair by the wife, and is renewed as frequently as her scanty means\\r\\npermit.\\r\\n\\r\\nThirty years ago John Hardshaw and his wife lived on Rincon Hill in one\\r\\nof the finest residences of that once aristocratic quarter. He had once\\r\\nbeen a physician, but having inherited a considerable estate from his\\r\\nfather concerned himself no more about the ailments of his\\r\\nfellow-creatures and found as much work as he cared for in managing his\\r\\nown affairs. Both he and his wife were highly cultivated persons, and\\r\\ntheir house was frequented by a small set of such men and women as\\r\\npersons of their tastes would think worth knowing. So far as these knew,\\r\\nMr. and Mrs. Hardshaw lived happily together; certainly the wife was\\r\\ndevoted to her handsome and accomplished husband and exceedingly proud\\r\\nof him.\\r\\n\\r\\nAmong their acquaintances were the Barwells--man, wife and two young\\r\\nchildren--of Sacramento. Mr. Barwell was a civil and mining engineer,\\r\\nwhose duties took him much from home and frequently to San Francisco. On\\r\\nthese occasions his wife commonly accompanied him and passed much of her\\r\\ntime at the house of her friend, Mrs. Hardshaw, always with her two\\r\\nchildren, of whom Mrs. Hardshaw, childless herself, grew fond.\\r\\nUnluckily, her husband grew equally fond of their mother--a good deal\\r\\nfonder. Still more unluckily, that attractive lady was less wise than\\r\\nweak.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt about three o\\'clock one autumn morning Officer No. 13 of the\\r\\nSacramento police saw a man stealthily leaving the rear entrance of a\\r\\ngentleman\\'s residence and promptly arrested him. The man--who wore a\\r\\nslouch hat and shaggy overcoat--offered the policeman one hundred, then\\r\\nfive hundred, then one thousand dollars to be released. As he had less\\r\\nthan the first mentioned sum on his person the officer treated his\\r\\nproposal with virtuous contempt. Before reaching the station the\\r\\nprisoner agreed to give him a check for ten thousand dollars and remain\\r\\nironed in the willows along the river bank until it should be paid. As\\r\\nthis only provoked new derision he would say no more, merely giving an\\r\\nobviously fictitious name. When he was searched at the station nothing\\r\\nof value was found on him but a miniature portrait of Mrs. Barwell--the\\r\\nlady of the house at which he was caught. The case was set with costly\\r\\ndiamonds; and something in the quality of the man\\'s linen sent a pang of\\r\\nunavailing regret through the severely incorruptible bosom of Officer\\r\\nNo. 13. There was nothing about the prisoner\\'s clothing nor person to\\r\\nidentify him and he was booked for burglary under the name that he had\\r\\ngiven, the honorable name of John K. Smith. The K. was an inspiration\\r\\nupon which, doubtless, he greatly prided himself.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the mean time the mysterious disappearance of John Hardshaw was\\r\\nagitating the gossips of Rincon Hill in San Francisco, and was even\\r\\nmentioned in one of the newspapers. It did not occur to the lady whom\\r\\nthat journal considerately described as his \"widow,\" to look for him in\\r\\nthe city prison at Sacramento--a town which he was not known ever to\\r\\nhave visited. As John K. Smith he was arraigned and, waiving\\r\\nexamination, committed for trial.\\r\\n\\r\\nAbout two weeks before the trial, Mrs. Hardshaw, accidentally learning\\r\\nthat her husband was held in Sacramento under an assumed name on a\\r\\ncharge of burglary, hastened to that city without daring to mention the\\r\\nmatter to any one and presented herself at the prison, asking for an\\r\\ninterview with her husband, John K. Smith. Haggard and ill with anxiety,\\r\\nwearing a plain traveling wrap which covered her from neck to foot, and\\r\\nin which she had passed the night on the steamboat, too anxious to\\r\\nsleep, she hardly showed for what she was, but her manner pleaded for\\r\\nher more strongly than anything that she chose to say in evidence of her\\r\\nright to admittance. She was permitted to see him alone.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat occurred during that distressing interview has never transpired;\\r\\nbut later events prove that Hardshaw had found means to subdue her will\\r\\nto his own. She left the prison, a broken-hearted woman, refusing to\\r\\nanswer a single question, and returning to her desolate home renewed, in\\r\\na half-hearted way, her inquiries for her missing husband. A week later\\r\\nshe was herself missing: she had \"gone back to the States\"--nobody knew\\r\\nany more than that.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn his trial the prisoner pleaded guilty--\"by advice of his counsel,\" so\\r\\nhis counsel said. Nevertheless, the judge, in whose mind several unusual\\r\\ncircumstances had created a doubt, insisted on the district attorney\\r\\nplacing Officer No. 13 on the stand, and the deposition of Mrs. Barwell,\\r\\nwho was too ill to attend, was read to the jury. It was very brief: she\\r\\nknew nothing of the matter except that the likeness of herself was her\\r\\nproperty, and had, she thought, been left on the parlor table when she\\r\\nhad retired on the night of the arrest. She had intended it as a present\\r\\nto her husband, then and still absent in Europe on business for a mining\\r\\ncompany.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis witness\\'s manner when making the deposition at her residence was\\r\\nafterward described by the district attorney as most extraordinary.\\r\\nTwice she had refused to testify, and once, when the deposition lacked\\r\\nnothing but her signature, she had caught it from the clerk\\'s hands and\\r\\ntorn it in pieces. She had called her children to the bedside and\\r\\nembraced them with streaming eyes, then suddenly sending them from the\\r\\nroom, she verified her statement by oath and signature, and fainted--\\r\\n\"slick away,\" said the district attorney. It was at that time that her\\r\\nphysician, arriving upon the scene, took in the situation at a glance\\r\\nand grasping the representative of the law by the collar chucked him\\r\\ninto the street and kicked his assistant after him. The insulted majesty\\r\\nof the law was not vindicated; the victim of the indignity did not even\\r\\nmention anything of all this in court. He was ambitious to win his case,\\r\\nand the circumstances of the taking of that deposition were not such as\\r\\nwould give it weight if related; and after all, the man on trial had\\r\\ncommitted an offense against the law\\'s majesty only less heinous than\\r\\nthat of the irascible physician.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy suggestion of the judge the jury rendered a verdict of guilty; there\\r\\nwas nothing else to do, and the prisoner was sentenced to the\\r\\npenitentiary for three years. His counsel, who had objected to nothing\\r\\nand had made no plea for lenity--had, in fact, hardly said a word--wrung\\r\\nhis client\\'s hand and left the room. It was obvious to the whole bar\\r\\nthat he had been engaged only to prevent the court from appointing\\r\\ncounsel who might possibly insist on making a defense.\\r\\n\\r\\nJohn Hardshaw served out his term at San Quentin, and when discharged\\r\\nwas met at the prison gates by his wife, who had returned from \"the\\r\\nStates\" to receive him. It is thought they went straight to Europe;\\r\\nanyhow, a general power-of-attorney to a lawyer still living among us--\\r\\nfrom whom I have many of the facts of this simple history--was executed\\r\\nin Paris. This lawyer in a short time sold everything that Hardshaw\\r\\nowned in California, and for years nothing was heard of the unfortunate\\r\\ncouple; though many to whose ears had come vague and inaccurate\\r\\nintimations of their strange story, and who had known them, recalled\\r\\ntheir personality with tenderness and their misfortunes with compassion.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome years later they returned, both broken in fortune and spirits and\\r\\nhe in health. The purpose of their return I have not been able to\\r\\nascertain. For some time they lived, under the name of Johnson, in a\\r\\nrespectable enough quarter south of Market Street, pretty well put, and\\r\\nwere never seen away from the vicinity of their dwelling. They must have\\r\\nhad a little money left, for it is not known that the man had any\\r\\noccupation, the state of his health probably not permitting. The woman\\'s\\r\\ndevotion to her invalid husband was matter of remark among their\\r\\nneighbors; she seemed never absent from his side and always supporting\\r\\nand cheering him. They would sit for hours on one of the benches in a\\r\\nlittle public park, she reading to him, his hand in hers, her light\\r\\ntouch occasionally visiting his pale brow, her still beautiful eyes\\r\\nfrequently lifted from the book to look into his as she made some\\r\\ncomment on the text, or closed the volume to beguile his mood with talk\\r\\nof--what? Nobody ever overheard a conversation between these two. The\\r\\nreader who has had the patience to follow their history to this point\\r\\nmay possibly find a pleasure in conjecture: there was probably something\\r\\nto be avoided. The bearing of the man was one of profound dejection;\\r\\nindeed, the unsympathetic youth of the neighborhood, with that keen\\r\\nsense for visible characteristics which ever distinguishes the young\\r\\nmale of our species, sometimes mentioned him among themselves by the\\r\\nname of Spoony Glum.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt occurred one day that John Hardshaw was possessed by the spirit of\\r\\nunrest. God knows what led him whither he went, but he crossed Market\\r\\nStreet and held his way northward over the hills, and downward into the\\r\\nregion known as North Beach. Turning aimlessly to the left he followed\\r\\nhis toes along an unfamiliar street until he was opposite what for that\\r\\nperiod was a rather grand dwelling, and for this is a rather shabby\\r\\nfactory. Casting his eyes casually upward he saw at an open window what\\r\\nit had been better that he had not seen--the face and figure of Elvira\\r\\nBarwell. Their eyes met. With a sharp exclamation, like the cry of a\\r\\nstartled bird, the lady sprang to her feet and thrust her body half out\\r\\nof the window, clutching the casing on each side. Arrested by the cry,\\r\\nthe people in the street below looked up. Hardshaw stood motionless,\\r\\nspeechless, his eyes two flames. \"Take care!\" shouted some one in the\\r\\ncrowd, as the woman strained further and further forward, defying the\\r\\nsilent, implacable law of gravitation, as once she had defied that other\\r\\nlaw which God thundered from Sinai. The suddenness of her movements had\\r\\ntumbled a torrent of dark hair down her shoulders, and now it was blown\\r\\nabout her cheeks, almost concealing her face. A moment so, and then--! A\\r\\nfearful cry rang through the street, as, losing her balance, she pitched\\r\\nheadlong from the window, a confused and whirling mass of skirts, limbs,\\r\\nhair, and white face, and struck the pavement with a horrible sound and\\r\\na force of impact that was felt a hundred feet away. For a moment all\\r\\neyes refused their office and turned from the sickening spectacle on the\\r\\nsidewalk. Drawn again to that horror, they saw it strangely augmented. A\\r\\nman, hatless, seated flat upon the paving stones, held the broken,\\r\\nbleeding body against his breast, kissing the mangled cheeks and\\r\\nstreaming mouth through tangles of wet hair, his own features\\r\\nindistinguishably crimson with the blood that half-strangled him and ran\\r\\nin rills from his soaken beard.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe reporter\\'s task is nearly finished. The Barwells had that very\\r\\nmorning returned from a two years\\' absence in Peru. A week later the\\r\\nwidower, now doubly desolate, since there could be no missing the\\r\\nsignificance of Hardshaw\\'s horrible demonstration, had sailed for I know\\r\\nnot what distant port; he has never come back to stay. Hardshaw--as\\r\\nJohnson no longer--passed a year in the Stockton asylum for the insane,\\r\\nwhere also, through the influence of pitying friends, his wife was\\r\\nadmitted to care for him. When he was discharged, not cured but\\r\\nharmless, they returned to the city; it would seem ever to have had some\\r\\ndreadful fascination for them. For a time they lived near the Mission\\r\\nDolores, in poverty only less abject than that which is their present\\r\\nlot; but it was too far away from the objective point of the man\\'s daily\\r\\npilgrimage. They could not afford car fare. So that poor devil of an\\r\\nangel from Heaven--wife to this convict and lunatic--obtained, at a fair\\r\\nenough rental, the blank-faced shanty on the lower terrace of Goat Hill.\\r\\nThence to the structure that was a dwelling and is a factory the\\r\\ndistance is not so great; it is, in fact, an agreeable walk, judging\\r\\nfrom the man\\'s eager and cheerful look as he takes it. The return\\r\\njourney appears to be a trifle wearisome.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAN ADVENTURE AT BROWNVILLE[1]\\r\\n\\r\\n[1] This story was written in collaboration with Miss Ina Lillian\\r\\nPeterson, to whom is rightly due the credit for whatever merit it may\\r\\nhave.\\r\\n\\r\\nI taught a little country school near Brownville, which, as every one\\r\\nknows who has had the good luck to live there, is the capital of a\\r\\nconsiderable expanse of the finest scenery in California. The town is\\r\\nsomewhat frequented in summer by a class of persons whom it is the habit\\r\\nof the local journal to call \"pleasure seekers,\" but who by a juster\\r\\nclassification would be known as \"the sick and those in adversity.\"\\r\\nBrownville itself might rightly enough be described, indeed, as a summer\\r\\nplace of last resort. It is fairly well endowed with boarding-houses, at\\r\\nthe least pernicious of which I performed twice a day (lunching at the\\r\\nschoolhouse) the humble rite of cementing the alliance between soul and\\r\\nbody. From this \"hostelry\" (as the local journal preferred to call it\\r\\nwhen it did not call it a \"caravanserai\") to the schoolhouse the\\r\\ndistance by the wagon road was about a mile and a half; but there was a\\r\\ntrail, very little used, which led over an intervening range of low,\\r\\nheavily wooded hills, considerably shortening the distance. By this\\r\\ntrail I was returning one evening later than usual. It was the last day\\r\\nof the term and I had been detained at the schoolhouse until almost\\r\\ndark, preparing an account of my stewardship for the trustees--two of\\r\\nwhom, I proudly reflected, would be able to read it, and the third (an\\r\\ninstance of the dominion of mind over matter) would be overruled in his\\r\\ncustomary antagonism to the schoolmaster of his own creation.\\r\\n\\r\\nI had gone not more than a quarter of the way when, finding an interest\\r\\nin the antics of a family of lizards which dwelt thereabout and seemed\\r\\nfull of reptilian joy for their immunity from the ills incident to life\\r\\nat the Brownville House, I sat upon a fallen tree to observe them. As I\\r\\nleaned wearily against a branch of the gnarled old trunk the twilight\\r\\ndeepened in the somber woods and the faint new moon began casting\\r\\nvisible shadows and gilding the leaves of the trees with a tender but\\r\\nghostly light.\\r\\n\\r\\nI heard the sound of voices--a woman\\'s, angry, impetuous, rising against\\r\\ndeep masculine tones, rich and musical. I strained my eyes, peering\\r\\nthrough the dusky shadows of the wood, hoping to get a view of the\\r\\nintruders on my solitude, but could see no one. For some yards in each\\r\\ndirection I had an uninterrupted view of the trail, and knowing of no\\r\\nother within a half mile thought the persons heard must be approaching\\r\\nfrom the wood at one side. There was no sound but that of the voices,\\r\\nwhich were now so distinct that I could catch the words. That of the man\\r\\ngave me an impression of anger, abundantly confirmed by the matter\\r\\nspoken.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I will have no threats; you are powerless, as you very well know. Let\\r\\nthings remain as they are or, by God! you shall both suffer for it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What do you mean?\"--this was the voice of the woman, a cultivated\\r\\nvoice, the voice of a lady. \"You would not--murder us.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was no reply, at least none that was audible to me. During the\\r\\nsilence I peered into the wood in hope to get a glimpse of the speakers,\\r\\nfor I felt sure that this was an affair of gravity in which ordinary\\r\\nscruples ought not to count. It seemed to me that the woman was in\\r\\nperil; at any rate the man had not disavowed a willingness to murder.\\r\\nWhen a man is enacting the r\\xc3\\xb4le of potential assassin he has not the\\r\\nright to choose his audience.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter some little time I saw them, indistinct in the moonlight among the\\r\\ntrees. The man, tall and slender, seemed clothed in black; the woman\\r\\nwore, as nearly as I could make out, a gown of gray stuff. Evidently\\r\\nthey were still unaware of my presence in the shadow, though for some\\r\\nreason when they renewed their conversation they spoke in lower tones\\r\\nand I could no longer understand. As I looked the woman seemed to sink\\r\\nto the ground and raise her hands in supplication, as is frequently done\\r\\non the stage and never, so far as I knew, anywhere else, and I am now\\r\\nnot altogether sure that it was done in this instance. The man fixed his\\r\\neyes upon her; they seemed to glitter bleakly in the moonlight with an\\r\\nexpression that made me apprehensive that he would turn them upon me. I\\r\\ndo not know by what impulse I was moved, but I sprang to my feet out of\\r\\nthe shadow. At that instant the figures vanished. I peered in vain\\r\\nthrough the spaces among the trees and clumps of undergrowth. The night\\r\\nwind rustled the leaves; the lizards had retired early, reptiles of\\r\\nexemplary habits. The little moon was already slipping behind a black\\r\\nhill in the west.\\r\\n\\r\\nI went home, somewhat disturbed in mind, half doubting that I had heard\\r\\nor seen any living thing excepting the lizards. It all seemed a trifle\\r\\nodd and uncanny. It was as if among the several phenomena, objective and\\r\\nsubjective, that made the sum total of the incident there had been an\\r\\nuncertain element which had diffused its dubious character over all--had\\r\\nleavened the whole mass with unreality. I did not like it.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the breakfast table the next morning there was a new face; opposite\\r\\nme sat a young woman at whom I merely glanced as I took my seat. In\\r\\nspeaking to the high and mighty female personage who condescended to\\r\\nseem to wait upon us, this girl soon invited my attention by the sound\\r\\nof her voice, which was like, yet not altogether like, the one still\\r\\nmurmuring in my memory of the previous evening\\'s adventure. A moment\\r\\nlater another girl, a few years older, entered the room and sat at the\\r\\nleft of the other, speaking to her a gentle \"good morning.\" By _her_\\r\\nvoice I was startled: it was without doubt the one of which the first\\r\\ngirl\\'s had reminded me. Here was the lady of the sylvan incident sitting\\r\\nbodily before me, \"in her habit as she lived.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nEvidently enough the two were sisters.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith a nebulous kind of apprehension that I might be recognized as the\\r\\nmute inglorious hero of an adventure which had in my consciousness and\\r\\nconscience something of the character of eavesdropping, I allowed myself\\r\\nonly a hasty cup of the lukewarm coffee thoughtfully provided by the\\r\\nprescient waitress for the emergency, and left the table. As I passed\\r\\nout of the house into the grounds I heard a rich, strong male voice\\r\\nsinging an aria from \"Rigoletto.\" I am bound to say that it was\\r\\nexquisitely sung, too, but there was something in the performance that\\r\\ndispleased me, I could say neither what nor why, and I walked rapidly\\r\\naway.\\r\\n\\r\\nReturning later in the day I saw the elder of the two young women\\r\\nstanding on the porch and near her a tall man in black clothing--the man\\r\\nwhom I had expected to see. All day the desire to know something of\\r\\nthese persons had been uppermost in my mind and I now resolved to learn\\r\\nwhat I could of them in any way that was neither dishonorable nor low.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe man was talking easily and affably to his companion, but at the\\r\\nsound of my footsteps on the gravel walk he ceased, and turning about\\r\\nlooked me full in the face. He was apparently of middle age, dark and\\r\\nuncommonly handsome. His attire was faultless, his bearing easy and\\r\\ngraceful, the look which he turned upon me open, free, and devoid of any\\r\\nsuggestion of rudeness. Nevertheless it affected me with a distinct\\r\\nemotion which on subsequent analysis in memory appeared to be compounded\\r\\nof hatred and dread--I am unwilling to call it fear. A second later the\\r\\nman and woman had disappeared. They seemed to have a trick of\\r\\ndisappearing. On entering the house, however, I saw them through the\\r\\nopen doorway of the parlor as I passed; they had merely stepped through\\r\\na window which opened down to the floor.\\r\\n\\r\\nCautiously \"approached\" on the subject of her new guests my landlady\\r\\nproved not ungracious. Restated with, I hope, some small reverence for\\r\\nEnglish grammar the facts were these: the two girls were Pauline and Eva\\r\\nMaynard of San Francisco; the elder was Pauline. The man was Richard\\r\\nBenning, their guardian, who had been the most intimate friend of their\\r\\nfather, now deceased. Mr. Benning had brought them to Brownville in the\\r\\nhope that the mountain climate might benefit Eva, who was thought to be\\r\\nin danger of consumption.\\r\\n\\r\\nUpon these short and simple annals the landlady wrought an embroidery of\\r\\neulogium which abundantly attested her faith in Mr. Benning\\'s will and\\r\\nability to pay for the best that her house afforded. That he had a good\\r\\nheart was evident to her from his devotion to his two beautiful wards\\r\\nand his really touching solicitude for their comfort. The evidence\\r\\nimpressed me as insufficient and I silently found the Scotch verdict,\\r\\n\"Not proven.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nCertainly Mr. Benning was most attentive to his wards. In my strolls\\r\\nabout the country I frequently encountered them--sometimes in company\\r\\nwith other guests of the hotel--exploring the gulches, fishing, rifle\\r\\nshooting, and otherwise wiling away the monotony of country life; and\\r\\nalthough I watched them as closely as good manners would permit I saw\\r\\nnothing that would in any way explain the strange words that I had\\r\\noverheard in the wood. I had grown tolerably well acquainted with the\\r\\nyoung ladies and could exchange looks and even greetings with their\\r\\nguardian without actual repugnance.\\r\\n\\r\\nA month went by and I had almost ceased to interest myself in their\\r\\naffairs when one night our entire little community was thrown into\\r\\nexcitement by an event which vividly recalled my experience in the\\r\\nforest.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis was the death of the elder girl, Pauline.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe sisters had occupied the same bedroom on the third floor of the\\r\\nhouse. Waking in the gray of the morning Eva had found Pauline dead\\r\\nbeside her. Later, when the poor girl was weeping beside the body amid a\\r\\nthrong of sympathetic if not very considerate persons, Mr. Benning\\r\\nentered the room and appeared to be about to take her hand. She drew\\r\\naway from the side of the dead and moved slowly toward the door.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is you,\" she said--\"you who have done this. You--you--you!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"She is raving,\" he said in a low voice. He followed her, step by step,\\r\\nas she retreated, his eyes fixed upon hers with a steady gaze in which\\r\\nthere was nothing of tenderness nor of compassion. She stopped; the hand\\r\\nthat she had raised in accusation fell to her side, her dilated eyes\\r\\ncontracted visibly, the lids slowly dropped over them, veiling their\\r\\nstrange wild beauty, and she stood motionless and almost as white as the\\r\\ndead girl lying near. The man took her hand and put his arm gently about\\r\\nher shoulders, as if to support her. Suddenly she burst into a passion\\r\\nof tears and clung to him as a child to its mother. He smiled with a\\r\\nsmile that affected me most disagreeably--perhaps any kind of smile\\r\\nwould have done so--and led her silently out of the room.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was an inquest--and the customary verdict: the deceased, it\\r\\nappeared, came to her death through \"heart disease.\" It was before the\\r\\ninvention of heart _failure_, though the heart of poor Pauline had\\r\\nindubitably failed. The body was embalmed and taken to San Francisco by\\r\\nsome one summoned thence for the purpose, neither Eva nor Benning\\r\\naccompanying it. Some of the hotel gossips ventured to think that very\\r\\nstrange, and a few hardy spirits went so far as to think it very strange\\r\\nindeed; but the good landlady generously threw herself into the breach,\\r\\nsaying it was owing to the precarious nature of the girl\\'s health. It is\\r\\nnot of record that either of the two persons most affected and\\r\\napparently least concerned made any explanation.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne evening about a week after the death I went out upon the veranda of\\r\\nthe hotel to get a book that I had left there. Under some vines shutting\\r\\nout the moonlight from a part of the space I saw Richard Benning, for\\r\\nwhose apparition I was prepared by having previously heard the low,\\r\\nsweet voice of Eva Maynard, whom also I now discerned, standing before\\r\\nhim with one hand raised to his shoulder and her eyes, as nearly as I\\r\\ncould judge, gazing upward into his. He held her disengaged hand and his\\r\\nhead was bent with a singular dignity and grace. Their attitude was that\\r\\nof lovers, and as I stood in deep shadow to observe I felt even guiltier\\r\\nthan on that memorable night in the wood. I was about to retire, when\\r\\nthe girl spoke, and the contrast between her words and her attitude was\\r\\nso surprising that I remained, because I had merely forgotten to go\\r\\naway.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You will take my life,\" she said, \"as you did Pauline\\'s. I know your\\r\\nintention as well as I know your power, and I ask nothing, only that you\\r\\nfinish your work without needless delay and let me be at peace.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe made no reply--merely let go the hand that he was holding, removed\\r\\nthe other from his shoulder, and turning away descended the steps\\r\\nleading to the garden and disappeared in the shrubbery. But a moment\\r\\nlater I heard, seemingly from a great distance, his fine clear voice in\\r\\na barbaric chant, which as I listened brought before some inner\\r\\nspiritual sense a consciousness of some far, strange land peopled with\\r\\nbeings having forbidden powers. The song held me in a kind of spell, but\\r\\nwhen it had died away I recovered and instantly perceived what I thought\\r\\nan opportunity. I walked out of my shadow to where the girl stood. She\\r\\nturned and stared at me with something of the look, it seemed to me, of\\r\\na hunted hare. Possibly my intrusion had frightened her.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Miss Maynard,\" I said, \"I beg you to tell me who that man is and the\\r\\nnature of his power over you. Perhaps this is rude in me, but it is not\\r\\na matter for idle civilities. When a woman is in danger any man has a\\r\\nright to act.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe listened without visible emotion--almost I thought without interest,\\r\\nand when I had finished she closed her big blue eyes as if unspeakably\\r\\nweary.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You can do nothing,\" she said.\\r\\n\\r\\nI took hold of her arm, gently shaking her as one shakes a person\\r\\nfalling into a dangerous sleep.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You must rouse yourself,\" I said; \"something must be done and you must\\r\\ngive me leave to act. You have said that that man killed your sister,\\r\\nand I believe it--that he will kill you, and I believe that.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe merely raised her eyes to mine.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Will you not tell me all?\" I added.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"There is nothing to be done, I tell you--nothing. And if I could do\\r\\nanything I would not. It does not matter in the least. We shall be here\\r\\nonly two days more; we go away then, oh, so far! If you have observed\\r\\nanything, I beg you to be silent.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But this is madness, girl.\" I was trying by rough speech to break the\\r\\ndeadly repose of her manner. \"You have accused him of murder. Unless you\\r\\nexplain these things to me I shall lay the matter before the\\r\\nauthorities.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThis roused her, but in a way that I did not like. She lifted her head\\r\\nproudly and said: \"Do not meddle, sir, in what does not concern you.\\r\\nThis is my affair, Mr. Moran, not yours.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It concerns every person in the country--in the world,\" I answered,\\r\\nwith equal coldness. \"If you had no love for your sister I, at least, am\\r\\nconcerned for you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Listen,\" she interrupted, leaning toward me. \"I loved her, yes, God\\r\\nknows! But more than that--beyond all, beyond expression, I love _him_.\\r\\nYou have overheard a secret, but you shall not make use of it to harm\\r\\nhim. I shall deny all. Your word against mine--it will be that. Do you\\r\\nthink your \\'authorities\\' will believe you?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe was now smiling like an angel and, God help me! I was heels over\\r\\nhead in love with her! Did she, by some of the many methods of\\r\\ndivination known to her sex, read my feelings? Her whole manner had\\r\\naltered.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Come,\" she said, almost coaxingly, \"promise that you will not be\\r\\nimpolite again.\" She took my arm in the most friendly way. \"Come, I will\\r\\nwalk with you. He will not know--he will remain away all night.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nUp and down the veranda we paced in the moonlight, she seemingly\\r\\nforgetting her recent bereavement, cooing and murmuring girl-wise of\\r\\nevery kind of nothing in all Brownville; I silent, consciously awkward\\r\\nand with something of the feeling of being concerned in an intrigue. It\\r\\nwas a revelation--this most charming and apparently blameless creature\\r\\ncoolly and confessedly deceiving the man for whom a moment before she\\r\\nhad acknowledged and shown the supreme love which finds even death an\\r\\nacceptable endearment.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Truly,\" I thought in my inexperience, \"here is something new under the\\r\\nmoon.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd the moon must have smiled.\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore we parted I had exacted a promise that she would walk with me the\\r\\nnext afternoon--before going away forever--to the Old Mill, one of\\r\\nBrownville\\'s revered antiquities, erected in 1860.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If he is not about,\" she added gravely, as I let go the hand she had\\r\\ngiven me at parting, and of which, may the good saints forgive me, I\\r\\nstrove vainly to repossess myself when she had said it--so charming, as\\r\\nthe wise Frenchman has pointed out, do we find woman\\'s infidelity when\\r\\nwe are its objects, not its victims. In apportioning his benefactions\\r\\nthat night the Angel of Sleep overlooked me.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Brownville House dined early, and after dinner the next day Miss\\r\\nMaynard, who had not been at table, came to me on the veranda, attired\\r\\nin the demurest of walking costumes, saying not a word. \"He\" was\\r\\nevidently \"not about.\" We went slowly up the road that led to the Old\\r\\nMill. She was apparently not strong and at times took my arm,\\r\\nrelinquishing it and taking it again rather capriciously, I thought. Her\\r\\nmood, or rather her succession of moods, was as mutable as skylight in a\\r\\nrippling sea. She jested as if she had never heard of such a thing as\\r\\ndeath, and laughed on the lightest incitement, and directly afterward\\r\\nwould sing a few bars of some grave melody with such tenderness of\\r\\nexpression that I had to turn away my eyes lest she should see the\\r\\nevidence of her success in art, if art it was, not artlessness, as then\\r\\nI was compelled to think it. And she said the oddest things in the most\\r\\nunconventional way, skirting sometimes unfathomable abysms of thought,\\r\\nwhere I had hardly the courage to set foot. In short, she was\\r\\nfascinating in a thousand and fifty different ways, and at every step I\\r\\nexecuted a new and profounder emotional folly, a hardier spiritual\\r\\nindiscretion, incurring fresh liability to arrest by the constabulary of\\r\\nconscience for infractions of my own peace.\\r\\n\\r\\nArriving at the mill, she made no pretense of stopping, but turned into\\r\\na trail leading through a field of stubble toward a creek. Crossing by a\\r\\nrustic bridge we continued on the trail, which now led uphill to one of\\r\\nthe most picturesque spots in the country. The Eagle\\'s Nest, it was\\r\\ncalled--the summit of a cliff that rose sheer into the air to a height\\r\\nof hundreds of feet above the forest at its base. From this elevated\\r\\npoint we had a noble view of another valley and of the opposite hills\\r\\nflushed with the last rays of the setting sun.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs we watched the light escaping to higher and higher planes from the\\r\\nencroaching flood of shadow filling the valley we heard footsteps, and\\r\\nin another moment were joined by Richard Benning.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I saw you from the road,\" he said carelessly; \"so I came up.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBeing a fool, I neglected to take him by the throat and pitch him into\\r\\nthe treetops below, but muttered some polite lie instead. On the girl\\r\\nthe effect of his coming was immediate and unmistakable. Her face was\\r\\nsuffused with the glory of love\\'s transfiguration: the red light of the\\r\\nsunset had not been more obvious in her eyes than was now the lovelight\\r\\nthat replaced it.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am so glad you came!\" she said, giving him both her hands; and, God\\r\\nhelp me! it was manifestly true.\\r\\n\\r\\nSeating himself upon the ground he began a lively dissertation upon the\\r\\nwild flowers of the region, a number of which he had with him. In the\\r\\nmiddle of a facetious sentence he suddenly ceased speaking and fixed his\\r\\neyes upon Eva, who leaned against the stump of a tree, absently plaiting\\r\\ngrasses. She lifted her eyes in a startled way to his, as if she had\\r\\n_felt_ his look. She then rose, cast away her grasses, and moved slowly\\r\\naway from him. He also rose, continuing to look at her. He had still in\\r\\nhis hand the bunch of flowers. The girl turned, as if to speak, but said\\r\\nnothing. I recall clearly now something of which I was but\\r\\nhalf-conscious then--the dreadful contrast between the smile upon her\\r\\nlips and the terrified expression in her eyes as she met his steady and\\r\\nimperative gaze. I know nothing of how it happened, nor how it was that\\r\\nI did not sooner understand; I only know that with the smile of an angel\\r\\nupon her lips and that look of terror in her beautiful eyes Eva Maynard\\r\\nsprang from the cliff and shot crashing into the tops of the pines\\r\\nbelow!\\r\\n\\r\\nHow and how long afterward I reached the place I cannot say, but Richard\\r\\nBenning was already there, kneeling beside the dreadful thing that had\\r\\nbeen a woman.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"She is dead--quite dead,\" he said coldly. \"I will go to town for\\r\\nassistance. Please do me the favor to remain.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe rose to his feet and moved away, but in a moment had stopped and\\r\\nturned about.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You have doubtless observed, my friend,\" he said, \"that this was\\r\\nentirely her own act. I did not rise in time to prevent it, and you, not\\r\\nknowing her mental condition--you could not, of course, have suspected.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHis manner maddened me.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You are as much her assassin,\" I said, \"as if your damnable hands had\\r\\ncut her throat.\" He shrugged his shoulders without reply and, turning,\\r\\nwalked away. A moment later I heard, through the deepening shadows of\\r\\nthe wood into which he had disappeared, a rich, strong, baritone voice\\r\\nsinging \"_La donna e mobile_,\" from \"Rigoletto.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE FAMOUS GILSON BEQUEST\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was rough on Gilson. Such was the terse, cold, but not altogether\\r\\nunsympathetic judgment of the better public opinion at Mammon Hill--the\\r\\ndictum of respectability. The verdict of the opposite, or rather the\\r\\nopposing, element--the element that lurked red-eyed and restless about\\r\\nMoll Gurney\\'s \"deadfall,\" while respectability took it with sugar at Mr.\\r\\nJo. Bentley\\'s gorgeous \"saloon\"--was to pretty much the same general\\r\\neffect, though somewhat more ornately expressed by the use of\\r\\npicturesque expletives, which it is needless to quote. Virtually, Mammon\\r\\nHill was a unit on the Gilson question. And it must be confessed that in\\r\\na merely temporal sense all was not well with Mr. Gilson. He had that\\r\\nmorning been led into town by Mr. Brentshaw and publicly charged with\\r\\nhorse stealing; the sheriff meantime busying himself about The Tree with\\r\\na new manila rope and Carpenter Pete being actively employed between\\r\\ndrinks upon a pine box about the length and breadth of Mr. Gilson.\\r\\nSociety having rendered its verdict, there remained between Gilson and\\r\\neternity only the decent formality of a trial.\\r\\n\\r\\nThese are the short and simple annals of the prisoner: He had recently\\r\\nbeen a resident of New Jerusalem, on the north fork of the Little Stony,\\r\\nbut had come to the newly discovered placers of Mammon Hill immediately\\r\\nbefore the \"rush\" by which the former place was depopulated. The\\r\\ndiscovery of the new diggings had occurred opportunely for Mr. Gilson,\\r\\nfor it had only just before been intimated to him by a New Jerusalem\\r\\nvigilance committee that it would better his prospects in, and for, life\\r\\nto go somewhere; and the list of places to which he could safely go did\\r\\nnot include any of the older camps; so he naturally established himself\\r\\nat Mammon Hill. Being eventually followed thither by all his judges, he\\r\\nordered his conduct with considerable circumspection, but as he had\\r\\nnever been known to do an honest day\\'s work at any industry sanctioned\\r\\nby the stern local code of morality except draw poker he was still an\\r\\nobject of suspicion. Indeed, it was conjectured that he was the author\\r\\nof the many daring depredations that had recently been committed with\\r\\npan and brush on the sluice boxes.\\r\\n\\r\\nProminent among those in whom this suspicion had ripened into a\\r\\nsteadfast conviction was Mr. Brentshaw. At all seasonable and\\r\\nunseasonable times Mr. Brentshaw avowed his belief in Mr. Gilson\\'s\\r\\nconnection with these unholy midnight enterprises, and his own\\r\\nwillingness to prepare a way for the solar beams through the body of any\\r\\none who might think it expedient to utter a different opinion--which, in\\r\\nhis presence, no one was more careful not to do than the peace-loving\\r\\nperson most concerned. Whatever may have been the truth of the matter,\\r\\nit is certain that Gilson frequently lost more \"clean dust\" at Jo.\\r\\nBentley\\'s faro table than it was recorded in local history that he had\\r\\never honestly earned at draw poker in all the days of the camp\\'s\\r\\nexistence. But at last Mr. Bentley--fearing, it may be, to lose the more\\r\\nprofitable patronage of Mr. Brentshaw--peremptorily refused to let\\r\\nGilson copper the queen, intimating at the same time, in his frank,\\r\\nforthright way, that the privilege of losing money at \"this bank\" was a\\r\\nblessing appertaining to, proceeding logically from, and coterminous\\r\\nwith, a condition of notorious commercial righteousness and social good\\r\\nrepute.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Hill thought it high time to look after a person whom its most\\r\\nhonored citizen had felt it his duty to rebuke at a considerable\\r\\npersonal sacrifice. The New Jerusalem contingent, particularly, began to\\r\\nabate something of the toleration begotten of amusement at their own\\r\\nblunder in exiling an objectionable neighbor from the place which they\\r\\nhad left to the place whither they had come. Mammon Hill was at last of\\r\\none mind. Not much was said, but that Gilson must hang was \"in the air.\"\\r\\nBut at this critical juncture in his affairs he showed signs of an\\r\\naltered life if not a changed heart. Perhaps it was only that \"the bank\"\\r\\nbeing closed against him he had no further use for gold dust. Anyhow the\\r\\nsluice boxes were molested no more forever. But it was impossible to\\r\\nrepress the abounding energies of such a nature as his, and he\\r\\ncontinued, possibly from habit, the tortuous courses which he had\\r\\npursued for profit of Mr. Bentley. After a few tentative and resultless\\r\\nundertakings in the way of highway robbery--if one may venture to\\r\\ndesignate road-agency by so harsh a name--he made one or two modest\\r\\nessays in horse-herding, and it was in the midst of a promising\\r\\nenterprise of this character, and just as he had taken the tide in his\\r\\naffairs at its flood, that he made shipwreck. For on a misty, moonlight\\r\\nnight Mr. Brentshaw rode up alongside a person who was evidently leaving\\r\\nthat part of the country, laid a hand upon the halter connecting Mr.\\r\\nGilson\\'s wrist with Mr. Harper\\'s bay mare, tapped him familiarly on the\\r\\ncheek with the barrel of a navy revolver and requested the pleasure of\\r\\nhis company in a direction opposite to that in which he was traveling.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was indeed rough on Gilson.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the morning after his arrest he was tried, convicted, and sentenced.\\r\\nIt only remains, so far as concerns his earthly career, to hang him,\\r\\nreserving for more particular mention his last will and testament,\\r\\nwhich, with great labor, he contrived in prison, and in which, probably\\r\\nfrom some confused and imperfect notion of the rights of captors, he\\r\\nbequeathed everything he owned to his \"lawfle execketer,\" Mr. Brentshaw.\\r\\nThe bequest, however, was made conditional on the legatee taking the\\r\\ntestator\\'s body from The Tree and \"planting it white.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSo Mr. Gilson was--I was about to say \"swung off,\" but I fear there has\\r\\nbeen already something too much of slang in this straightforward\\r\\nstatement of facts; besides, the manner in which the law took its course\\r\\nis more accurately described in the terms employed by the judge in\\r\\npassing sentence: Mr. Gilson was \"strung up.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIn due season Mr. Brentshaw, somewhat touched, it may well be, by the\\r\\nempty compliment of the bequest, repaired to The Tree to pluck the fruit\\r\\nthereof. When taken down the body was found to have in its waistcoat\\r\\npocket a duly attested codicil to the will already noted. The nature of\\r\\nits provisions accounted for the manner in which it had been withheld,\\r\\nfor had Mr. Brentshaw previously been made aware of the conditions under\\r\\nwhich he was to succeed to the Gilson estate he would indubitably have\\r\\ndeclined the responsibility. Briefly stated, the purport of the codicil\\r\\nwas as follows:\\r\\n\\r\\nWhereas, at divers times and in sundry places, certain persons had\\r\\nasserted that during his life the testator had robbed their sluice\\r\\nboxes; therefore, if during the five years next succeeding the date of\\r\\nthis instrument any one should make proof of such assertion before a\\r\\ncourt of law, such person was to receive as reparation the entire\\r\\npersonal and real estate of which the testator died seized and\\r\\npossessed, minus the expenses of court and a stated compensation to the\\r\\nexecutor, Henry Clay Brentshaw; provided, that if more than one person\\r\\nmade such proof the estate was to be equally divided between or among\\r\\nthem. But in case none should succeed in so establishing the testator\\'s\\r\\nguilt, then the whole property, minus court expenses, as aforesaid,\\r\\nshould go to the said Henry Clay Brentshaw for his own use, as stated in\\r\\nthe will.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe syntax of this remarkable document was perhaps open to critical\\r\\nobjection, but that was clearly enough the meaning of it. The\\r\\northography conformed to no recognized system, but being mainly phonetic\\r\\nit was not ambiguous. As the probate judge remarked, it would take five\\r\\naces to beat it. Mr. Brentshaw smiled good-humoredly, and after\\r\\nperforming the last sad rites with amusing ostentation, had himself duly\\r\\nsworn as executor and conditional legatee under the provisions of a law\\r\\nhastily passed (at the instance of the member from the Mammon Hill\\r\\ndistrict) by a facetious legislature; which law was afterward discovered\\r\\nto have created also three or four lucrative offices and authorized the\\r\\nexpenditure of a considerable sum of public money for the construction\\r\\nof a certain railway bridge that with greater advantage might perhaps\\r\\nhave been erected on the line of some actual railway.\\r\\n\\r\\nOf course Mr. Brentshaw expected neither profit from the will nor\\r\\nlitigation in consequence of its unusual provisions; Gilson, although\\r\\nfrequently \"flush,\" had been a man whom assessors and tax collectors\\r\\nwere well satisfied to lose no money by. But a careless and merely\\r\\nformal search among his papers revealed title deeds to valuable estates\\r\\nin the East and certificates of deposit for incredible sums in banks\\r\\nless severely scrupulous than that of Mr. Jo. Bentley.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe astounding news got abroad directly, throwing the Hill into a fever\\r\\nof excitement. The Mammon Hill _Patriot_, whose editor had been a\\r\\nleading spirit in the proceedings that resulted in Gilson\\'s departure\\r\\nfrom New Jerusalem, published a most complimentary obituary notice of\\r\\nthe deceased, and was good enough to call attention to the fact that his\\r\\ndegraded contemporary, the Squaw Gulch _Clarion_, was bringing virtue\\r\\ninto contempt by beslavering with flattery the memory of one who in life\\r\\nhad spurned the vile sheet as a nuisance from his door. Undeterred by\\r\\nthe press, however, claimants under the will were not slow in presenting\\r\\nthemselves with their evidence; and great as was the Gilson estate it\\r\\nappeared conspicuously paltry considering the vast number of sluice\\r\\nboxes from which it was averred to have been obtained. The country rose\\r\\nas one man!\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Brentshaw was equal to the emergency. With a shrewd application of\\r\\nhumble auxiliary devices, he at once erected above the bones of his\\r\\nbenefactor a costly monument, overtopping every rough headboard in the\\r\\ncemetery, and on this he judiciously caused to be inscribed an epitaph\\r\\nof his own composing, eulogizing the honesty, public spirit and cognate\\r\\nvirtues of him who slept beneath, \"a victim to the unjust aspersions of\\r\\nSlander\\'s viper brood.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMoreover, he employed the best legal talent in the Territory to defend\\r\\nthe memory of his departed friend, and for five long years the\\r\\nTerritorial courts were occupied with litigation growing out of the\\r\\nGilson bequest. To fine forensic abilities Mr. Brentshaw opposed\\r\\nabilities more finely forensic; in bidding for purchasable favors he\\r\\noffered prices which utterly deranged the market; the judges found at\\r\\nhis hospitable board entertainment for man and beast, the like of which\\r\\nhad never been spread in the Territory; with mendacious witnesses he\\r\\nconfronted witnesses of superior mendacity.\\r\\n\\r\\nNor was the battle confined to the temple of the blind goddess--it\\r\\ninvaded the press, the pulpit, the drawing-room. It raged in the mart,\\r\\nthe exchange, the school; in the gulches, and on the street corners. And\\r\\nupon the last day of the memorable period to which legal action under\\r\\nthe Gilson will was limited, the sun went down upon a region in which\\r\\nthe moral sense was dead, the social conscience callous, the\\r\\nintellectual capacity dwarfed, enfeebled, and confused! But Mr.\\r\\nBrentshaw was victorious all along the line.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn that night it so happened that the cemetery in one corner of which\\r\\nlay the now honored ashes of the late Milton Gilson, Esq., was partly\\r\\nunder water. Swollen by incessant rains, Cat Creek had spilled over its\\r\\nbanks an angry flood which, after scooping out unsightly hollows\\r\\nwherever the soil had been disturbed, had partly subsided, as if ashamed\\r\\nof the sacrilege, leaving exposed much that had been piously concealed.\\r\\nEven the famous Gilson monument, the pride and glory of Mammon Hill, was\\r\\nno longer a standing rebuke to the \"viper brood\"; succumbing to the\\r\\nsapping current it had toppled prone to earth. The ghoulish flood had\\r\\nexhumed the poor, decayed pine coffin, which now lay half-exposed, in\\r\\npitiful contrast to the pompous monolith which, like a giant note of\\r\\nadmiration, emphasized the disclosure.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo this depressing spot, drawn by some subtle influence he had sought\\r\\nneither to resist nor analyze, came Mr. Brentshaw. An altered man was\\r\\nMr. Brentshaw. Five years of toil, anxiety, and wakefulness had dashed\\r\\nhis black locks with streaks and patches of gray, bowed his fine figure,\\r\\ndrawn sharp and angular his face, and debased his walk to a doddering\\r\\nshuffle. Nor had this lustrum of fierce contention wrought less upon his\\r\\nheart and intellect. The careless good humor that had prompted him to\\r\\naccept the trust of the dead man had given place to a fixed habit of\\r\\nmelancholy. The firm, vigorous intellect had overripened into the mental\\r\\nmellowness of second childhood. His broad understanding had narrowed to\\r\\nthe accommodation of a single idea; and in place of the quiet, cynical\\r\\nincredulity of former days, there was in him a haunting faith in the\\r\\nsupernatural, that flitted and fluttered about his soul, shadowy,\\r\\nbatlike, ominous of insanity. Unsettled in all else, his understanding\\r\\nclung to one conviction with the tenacity of a wrecked intellect. That\\r\\nwas an unshaken belief in the entire blamelessness of the dead Gilson.\\r\\nHe had so often sworn to this in court and asserted it in private\\r\\nconversation--had so frequently and so triumphantly established it by\\r\\ntestimony that had come expensive to him (for that very day he had paid\\r\\nthe last dollar of the Gilson estate to Mr. Jo. Bentley, the last\\r\\nwitness to the Gilson good character)--that it had become to him a sort\\r\\nof religious faith. It seemed to him the one great central and basic\\r\\ntruth of life--the sole serene verity in a world of lies.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn that night, as he seated himself pensively upon the prostrate\\r\\nmonument, trying by the uncertain moonlight to spell out the epitaph\\r\\nwhich five years before he had composed with a chuckle that memory had\\r\\nnot recorded, tears of remorse came into his eyes as he remembered that\\r\\nhe had been mainly instrumental in compassing by a false accusation this\\r\\ngood man\\'s death; for during some of the legal proceedings, Mr. Harper,\\r\\nfor a consideration (forgotten) had come forward and sworn that in the\\r\\nlittle transaction with his bay mare the deceased had acted in strict\\r\\naccordance with the Harperian wishes, confidentially communicated to the\\r\\ndeceased and by him faithfully concealed at the cost of his life. All\\r\\nthat Mr. Brentshaw had since done for the dead man\\'s memory seemed\\r\\npitifully inadequate--most mean, paltry, and debased with selfishness!\\r\\n\\r\\nAs he sat there, torturing himself with futile regrets, a faint shadow\\r\\nfell across his eyes. Looking toward the moon, hanging low in the west,\\r\\nhe saw what seemed a vague, watery cloud obscuring her; but as it moved\\r\\nso that her beams lit up one side of it he perceived the clear, sharp\\r\\noutline of a human figure. The apparition became momentarily more\\r\\ndistinct, and grew, visibly; it was drawing near. Dazed as were his\\r\\nsenses, half locked up with terror and confounded with dreadful\\r\\nimaginings, Mr. Brentshaw yet could but perceive, or think he perceived,\\r\\nin this unearthly shape a strange similitude to the mortal part of the\\r\\nlate Milton Gilson, as that person had looked when taken from The Tree\\r\\nfive years before. The likeness was indeed complete, even to the full,\\r\\nstony eyes, and a certain shadowy circle about the neck. It was without\\r\\ncoat or hat, precisely as Gilson had been when laid in his poor, cheap\\r\\ncasket by the not ungentle hands of Carpenter Pete--for whom some one\\r\\nhad long since performed the same neighborly office. The spectre, if\\r\\nsuch it was, seemed to bear something in its hands which Mr. Brentshaw\\r\\ncould not clearly make out. It drew nearer, and paused at last beside\\r\\nthe coffin containing the ashes of the late Mr. Gilson, the lid of which\\r\\nwas awry, half disclosing the uncertain interior. Bending over this, the\\r\\nphantom seemed to shake into it from a basin some dark substance of\\r\\ndubious consistency, then glided stealthily back to the lowest part of\\r\\nthe cemetery. Here the retiring flood had stranded a number of open\\r\\ncoffins, about and among which it gurgled with low sobbings and stilly\\r\\nwhispers. Stooping over one of these, the apparition carefully brushed\\r\\nits contents into the basin, then returning to its own casket, emptied\\r\\nthe vessel into that, as before. This mysterious operation was repeated\\r\\nat every exposed coffin, the ghost sometimes dipping its laden basin\\r\\ninto the running water, and gently agitating it to free it of the baser\\r\\nclay, always hoarding the residuum in its own private box. In short, the\\r\\nimmortal part of the late Milton Gilson was cleaning up the dust of its\\r\\nneighbors and providently adding the same to its own.\\r\\n\\r\\nPerhaps it was a phantasm of a disordered mind in a fevered body.\\r\\nPerhaps it was a solemn farce enacted by pranking existences that throng\\r\\nthe shadows lying along the border of another world. God knows; to us is\\r\\npermitted only the knowledge that when the sun of another day touched\\r\\nwith a grace of gold the ruined cemetery of Mammon Hill his kindliest\\r\\nbeam fell upon the white, still face of Henry Brentshaw, dead among the\\r\\ndead.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE APPLICANT\\r\\n\\r\\nPushing his adventurous shins through the deep snow that had fallen\\r\\novernight, and encouraged by the glee of his little sister, following in\\r\\nthe open way that he made, a sturdy small boy, the son of Grayville\\'s\\r\\nmost distinguished citizen, struck his foot against something of which\\r\\nthere was no visible sign on the surface of the snow. It is the purpose\\r\\nof this narrative to explain how it came to be there.\\r\\n\\r\\nNo one who has had the advantage of passing through Grayville by day can\\r\\nhave failed to observe the large stone building crowning the low hill to\\r\\nthe north of the railway station--that is to say, to the right in going\\r\\ntoward Great Mowbray. It is a somewhat dull-looking edifice, of the\\r\\nEarly Comatose order, and appears to have been designed by an architect\\r\\nwho shrank from publicity, and although unable to conceal his work--even\\r\\ncompelled, in this instance, to set it on an eminence in the sight of\\r\\nmen--did what he honestly could to insure it against a second look. So\\r\\nfar as concerns its outer and visible aspect, the Abersush Home for Old\\r\\nMen is unquestionably inhospitable to human attention. But it is a\\r\\nbuilding of great magnitude, and cost its benevolent founder the profit\\r\\nof many a cargo of the teas and silks and spices that his ships brought\\r\\nup from the under-world when he was in trade in Boston; though the main\\r\\nexpense was its endowment. Altogether, this reckless person had robbed\\r\\nhis heirs-at-law of no less a sum than half a million dollars and flung\\r\\nit away in riotous giving. Possibly it was with a view to get out of\\r\\nsight of the silent big witness to his extravagance that he shortly\\r\\nafterward disposed of all his Grayville property that remained to him,\\r\\nturned his back upon the scene of his prodigality and went off across\\r\\nthe sea in one of his own ships. But the gossips who got their\\r\\ninspiration most directly from Heaven declared that he went in search of\\r\\na wife--a theory not easily reconciled with that of the village\\r\\nhumorist, who solemnly averred that the bachelor philanthropist had\\r\\ndeparted this life (left Grayville, to wit) because the marriageable\\r\\nmaidens had made it too hot to hold him. However this may have been, he\\r\\nhad not returned, and although at long intervals there had come to\\r\\nGrayville, in a desultory way, vague rumors of his wanderings in strange\\r\\nlands, no one seemed certainly to know about him, and to the new\\r\\ngeneration he was no more than a name. But from above the portal of the\\r\\nHome for Old Men the name shouted in stone.\\r\\n\\r\\nDespite its unpromising exterior, the Home is a fairly commodious place\\r\\nof retreat from the ills that its inmates have incurred by being poor\\r\\nand old and men. At the time embraced in this brief chronicle they were\\r\\nin number about a score, but in acerbity, querulousness, and general\\r\\ningratitude they could hardly be reckoned at fewer than a hundred; at\\r\\nleast that was the estimate of the superintendent, Mr. Silas Tilbody. It\\r\\nwas Mr. Tilbody\\'s steadfast conviction that always, in admitting new old\\r\\nmen to replace those who had gone to another and a better Home, the\\r\\ntrustees had distinctly in will the infraction of his peace, and the\\r\\ntrial of his patience. In truth, the longer the institution was\\r\\nconnected with him, the stronger was his feeling that the founder\\'s\\r\\nscheme of benevolence was sadly impaired by providing any inmates at\\r\\nall. He had not much imagination, but with what he had he was addicted\\r\\nto the reconstruction of the Home for Old Men into a kind of \"castle in\\r\\nSpain,\" with himself as castellan, hospitably entertaining about a score\\r\\nof sleek and prosperous middle-aged gentlemen, consummately good-humored\\r\\nand civilly willing to pay for their board and lodging. In this revised\\r\\nproject of philanthropy the trustees, to whom he was indebted for his\\r\\noffice and responsible for his conduct, had not the happiness to appear.\\r\\nAs to them, it was held by the village humorist aforementioned that in\\r\\ntheir management of the great charity Providence had thoughtfully\\r\\nsupplied an incentive to thrift. With the inference which he expected to\\r\\nbe drawn from that view we have nothing to do; it had neither support\\r\\nnor denial from the inmates, who certainly were most concerned. They\\r\\nlived out their little remnant of life, crept into graves neatly\\r\\nnumbered, and were succeeded by other old men as like them as could be\\r\\ndesired by the Adversary of Peace. If the Home was a place of punishment\\r\\nfor the sin of unthrift the veteran offenders sought justice with a\\r\\npersistence that attested the sincerity of their penitence. It is to one\\r\\nof these that the reader\\'s attention is now invited.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the matter of attire this person was not altogether engaging. But for\\r\\nthis season, which was midwinter, a careless observer might have looked\\r\\nupon him as a clever device of the husbandman indisposed to share the\\r\\nfruits of his toil with the crows that toil not, neither spin--an error\\r\\nthat might not have been dispelled without longer and closer observation\\r\\nthan he seemed to court; for his progress up Abersush Street, toward the\\r\\nHome in the gloom of the winter evening, was not visibly faster than\\r\\nwhat might have been expected of a scarecrow blessed with youth, health,\\r\\nand discontent. The man was indisputably ill-clad, yet not without a\\r\\ncertain fitness and good taste, withal; for he was obviously an\\r\\napplicant for admittance to the Home, where poverty was a qualification.\\r\\nIn the army of indigence the uniform is rags; they serve to distinguish\\r\\nthe rank and file from the recruiting officers.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs the old man, entering the gate of the grounds, shuffled up the broad\\r\\nwalk, already white with the fast-falling snow, which from time to time\\r\\nhe feebly shook from its various coigns of vantage on his person, he\\r\\ncame under inspection of the large globe lamp that burned always by\\r\\nnight over the great door of the building. As if unwilling to incur its\\r\\nrevealing beams, he turned to the left and, passing a considerable\\r\\ndistance along the face of the building, rang at a smaller door emitting\\r\\na dimmer ray that came from within, through the fanlight, and expended\\r\\nitself incuriously overhead. The door was opened by no less a personage\\r\\nthan the great Mr. Tilbody himself. Observing his visitor, who at once\\r\\nuncovered, and somewhat shortened the radius of the permanent curvature\\r\\nof his back, the great man gave visible token of neither surprise nor\\r\\ndispleasure. Mr. Tilbody was, indeed, in an uncommonly good humor, a\\r\\nphenomenon ascribable doubtless to the cheerful influence of the season;\\r\\nfor this was Christmas Eve, and the morrow would be that blessed 365th\\r\\npart of the year that all Christian souls set apart for mighty feats of\\r\\ngoodness and joy. Mr. Tilbody was so full of the spirit of the season\\r\\nthat his fat face and pale blue eyes, whose ineffectual fire served to\\r\\ndistinguish it from an untimely summer squash, effused so genial a glow\\r\\nthat it seemed a pity that he could not have lain down in it, basking in\\r\\nthe consciousness of his own identity. He was hatted, booted,\\r\\novercoated, and umbrellaed, as became a person who was about to expose\\r\\nhimself to the night and the storm on an errand of charity; for Mr.\\r\\nTilbody had just parted from his wife and children to go \"down town\" and\\r\\npurchase the wherewithal to confirm the annual falsehood about the\\r\\nhunch-bellied saint who frequents the chimneys to reward little boys and\\r\\ngirls who are good, and especially truthful. So he did not invite the\\r\\nold man in, but saluted him cheerily:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Hello! just in time; a moment later and you would have missed me. Come,\\r\\nI have no time to waste; we\\'ll walk a little way together.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Thank you,\" said the old man, upon whose thin and white but not ignoble\\r\\nface the light from the open door showed an expression that was perhaps\\r\\ndisappointment; \"but if the trustees--if my application--\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The trustees,\" Mr. Tilbody said, closing more doors than one, and\\r\\ncutting off two kinds of light, \"have agreed that your application\\r\\ndisagrees with them.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nCertain sentiments are inappropriate to Christmastide, but Humor, like\\r\\nDeath, has all seasons for his own.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, my God!\" cried the old man, in so thin and husky a tone that the\\r\\ninvocation was anything but impressive, and to at least one of his two\\r\\nauditors sounded, indeed, somewhat ludicrous. To the Other--but that is\\r\\na matter which laymen are devoid of the light to expound.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes,\" continued Mr. Tilbody, accommodating his gait to that of his\\r\\ncompanion, who was mechanically, and not very successfully, retracing\\r\\nthe track that he had made through the snow; \"they have decided that,\\r\\nunder the circumstances--under the very peculiar circumstances, you\\r\\nunderstand--it would be inexpedient to admit you. As superintendent and\\r\\n_ex officio_ secretary of the honorable board\"--as Mr. Tilbody \"read his\\r\\ntitle clear\" the magnitude of the big building, seen through its veil of\\r\\nfalling snow, appeared to suffer somewhat in comparison--\"it is my duty\\r\\nto inform you that, in the words of Deacon Byram, the chairman, your\\r\\npresence in the Home would--under the circumstances--be peculiarly\\r\\nembarrassing. I felt it my duty to submit to the honorable board the\\r\\nstatement that you made to me yesterday of your needs, your physical\\r\\ncondition, and the trials which it has pleased Providence to send upon\\r\\nyou in your very proper effort to present your claims in person; but,\\r\\nafter careful, and I may say prayerful, consideration of your case--with\\r\\nsomething too, I trust, of the large charitableness appropriate to the\\r\\nseason--it was decided that we would not be justified in doing anything\\r\\nlikely to impair the usefulness of the institution intrusted (under\\r\\nProvidence) to our care.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThey had now passed out of the grounds; the street lamp opposite the\\r\\ngate was dimly visible through the snow. Already the old man\\'s former\\r\\ntrack was obliterated, and he seemed uncertain as to which way he should\\r\\ngo. Mr. Tilbody had drawn a little away from him, but paused and turned\\r\\nhalf toward him, apparently reluctant to forego the continuing\\r\\nopportunity.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Under the circumstances,\" he resumed, \"the decision--\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the old man was inaccessible to the suasion of his verbosity; he had\\r\\ncrossed the street into a vacant lot and was going forward, rather\\r\\ndeviously toward nowhere in particular--which, he having nowhere in\\r\\nparticular to go to, was not so reasonless a proceeding as it looked.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd that is how it happened that the next morning, when the church bells\\r\\nof all Grayville were ringing with an added unction appropriate to the\\r\\nday, the sturdy little son of Deacon Byram, breaking a way through the\\r\\nsnow to the place of worship, struck his foot against the body of Amasa\\r\\nAbersush, philanthropist.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA WATCHER BY THE DEAD\\r\\n\\r\\nI\\r\\n\\r\\nIn an upper room of an unoccupied dwelling in the part of San Francisco\\r\\nknown as North Beach lay the body of a man, under a sheet. The hour was\\r\\nnear nine in the evening; the room was dimly lighted by a single candle.\\r\\nAlthough the weather was warm, the two windows, contrary to the custom\\r\\nwhich gives the dead plenty of air, were closed and the blinds drawn\\r\\ndown. The furniture of the room consisted of but three pieces--an\\r\\narm-chair, a small reading-stand supporting the candle, and a long\\r\\nkitchen table, supporting the body of the man. All these, as also the\\r\\ncorpse, seemed to have been recently brought in, for an observer, had\\r\\nthere been one, would have seen that all were free from dust, whereas\\r\\neverything else in the room was pretty thickly coated with it, and there\\r\\nwere cobwebs in the angles of the walls.\\r\\n\\r\\nUnder the sheet the outlines of the body could be traced, even the\\r\\nfeatures, these having that unnaturally sharp definition which seems to\\r\\nbelong to faces of the dead, but is really characteristic of those only\\r\\nthat have been wasted by disease. From the silence of the room one would\\r\\nrightly have inferred that it was not in the front of the house, facing\\r\\na street. It really faced nothing but a high breast of rock, the rear of\\r\\nthe building being set into a hill.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs a neighboring church clock was striking nine with an indolence which\\r\\nseemed to imply such an indifference to the flight of time that one\\r\\ncould hardly help wondering why it took the trouble to strike at all,\\r\\nthe single door of the room was opened and a man entered, advancing\\r\\ntoward the body. As he did so the door closed, apparently of its own\\r\\nvolition; there was a grating, as of a key turned with difficulty, and\\r\\nthe snap of the lock bolt as it shot into its socket. A sound of\\r\\nretiring footsteps in the passage outside ensued, and the man was to all\\r\\nappearance a prisoner. Advancing to the table, he stood a moment looking\\r\\ndown at the body; then with a slight shrug of the shoulders walked over\\r\\nto one of the windows and hoisted the blind. The darkness outside was\\r\\nabsolute, the panes were covered with dust, but by wiping this away he\\r\\ncould see that the window was fortified with strong iron bars crossing\\r\\nit within a few inches of the glass and imbedded in the masonry on each\\r\\nside. He examined the other window. It was the same. He manifested no\\r\\ngreat curiosity in the matter, did not even so much as raise the sash.\\r\\nIf he was a prisoner he was apparently a tractable one. Having completed\\r\\nhis examination of the room, he seated himself in the arm-chair, took a\\r\\nbook from his pocket, drew the stand with its candle alongside and began\\r\\nto read.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe man was young--not more than thirty--dark in complexion,\\r\\nsmooth-shaven, with brown hair. His face was thin and high-nosed, with a\\r\\nbroad forehead and a \"firmness\" of the chin and jaw which is said by\\r\\nthose having it to denote resolution. The eyes were gray and steadfast,\\r\\nnot moving except with definitive purpose. They were now for the greater\\r\\npart of the time fixed upon his book, but he occasionally withdrew them\\r\\nand turned them to the body on the table, not, apparently, from any\\r\\ndismal fascination which under such circumstances it might be supposed\\r\\nto exercise upon even a courageous person, nor with a conscious\\r\\nrebellion against the contrary influence which might dominate a timid\\r\\none. He looked at it as if in his reading he had come upon something\\r\\nrecalling him to a sense of his surroundings. Clearly this watcher by\\r\\nthe dead was discharging his trust with intelligence and composure, as\\r\\nbecame him.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter reading for perhaps a half-hour he seemed to come to the end of a\\r\\nchapter and quietly laid away the book. He then rose and taking the\\r\\nreading-stand from the floor carried it into a corner of the room near\\r\\none of the windows, lifted the candle from it and returned to the empty\\r\\nfireplace before which he had been sitting.\\r\\n\\r\\nA moment later he walked over to the body on the table, lifted the sheet\\r\\nand turned it back from the head, exposing a mass of dark hair and a\\r\\nthin face-cloth, beneath which the features showed with even sharper\\r\\ndefinition than before. Shading his eyes by interposing his free hand\\r\\nbetween them and the candle, he stood looking at his motionless\\r\\ncompanion with a serious and tranquil regard. Satisfied with his\\r\\ninspection, he pulled the sheet over the face again and returning to the\\r\\nchair, took some matches off the candlestick, put them in the side\\r\\npocket of his sack-coat and sat down. He then lifted the candle from its\\r\\nsocket and looked at it critically, as if calculating how long it would\\r\\nlast. It was barely two inches long; in another hour he would be in\\r\\ndarkness. He replaced it in the candlestick and blew it out.\\r\\n\\r\\nII\\r\\n\\r\\nIn a physician\\'s office in Kearny Street three men sat about a table,\\r\\ndrinking punch and smoking. It was late in the evening, almost midnight,\\r\\nindeed, and there had been no lack of punch. The gravest of the three,\\r\\nDr. Helberson, was the host--it was in his rooms they sat. He was about\\r\\nthirty years of age; the others were even younger; all were physicians.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The superstitious awe with which the living regard the dead,\" said Dr.\\r\\nHelberson, \"is hereditary and incurable. One needs no more be ashamed of\\r\\nit than of the fact that he inherits, for example, an incapacity for\\r\\nmathematics, or a tendency to lie.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe others laughed. \"Oughtn\\'t a man to be ashamed to lie?\" asked the\\r\\nyoungest of the three, who was in fact a medical student not yet\\r\\ngraduated.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My dear Harper, I said nothing about that. The tendency to lie is one\\r\\nthing; lying is another.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But do you think,\" said the third man, \"that this superstitious\\r\\nfeeling, this fear of the dead, reasonless as we know it to be, is\\r\\nuniversal? I am myself not conscious of it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, but it is \\'in your system\\' for all that,\" replied Helberson; \"it\\r\\nneeds only the right conditions--what Shakespeare calls the \\'confederate\\r\\nseason\\'--to manifest itself in some very disagreeable way that will open\\r\\nyour eyes. Physicians and soldiers are of course more nearly free from\\r\\nit than others.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Physicians and soldiers!--why don\\'t you add hangmen and headsmen? Let\\r\\nus have in all the assassin classes.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, my dear Mancher; the juries will not let the public executioners\\r\\nacquire sufficient familiarity with death to be altogether unmoved by\\r\\nit.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nYoung Harper, who had been helping himself to a fresh cigar at the\\r\\nsideboard, resumed his seat. \"What would you consider conditions under\\r\\nwhich any man of woman born would become insupportably conscious of his\\r\\nshare of our common weakness in this regard?\" he asked, rather\\r\\nverbosely.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, I should say that if a man were locked up all night with a\\r\\ncorpse--alone--in a dark room--of a vacant house--with no bed covers to\\r\\npull over his head--and lived through it without going altogether mad,\\r\\nhe might justly boast himself not of woman born, nor yet, like Macduff,\\r\\na product of C\\xc3\\xa6sarean section.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I thought you never would finish piling up conditions,\" said Harper,\\r\\n\"but I know a man who is neither a physician nor a soldier who will\\r\\naccept them all, for any stake you like to name.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Who is he?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"His name is Jarette--a stranger here; comes from my town in New York. I\\r\\nhave no money to back him, but he will back himself with loads of it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How do you know that?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He would rather bet than eat. As for fear--I dare say he thinks it some\\r\\ncutaneous disorder, or possibly a particular kind of religious heresy.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What does he look like?\" Helberson was evidently becoming interested.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Like Mancher, here--might be his twin brother.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I accept the challenge,\" said Helberson, promptly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Awfully obliged to you for the compliment, I\\'m sure,\" drawled Mancher,\\r\\nwho was growing sleepy. \"Can\\'t I get into this?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Not against me,\" Helberson said. \"I don\\'t want _your_ money.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"All right,\" said Mancher; \"I\\'ll be the corpse.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe others laughed.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe outcome of this crazy conversation we have seen.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIII\\r\\n\\r\\nIn extinguishing his meagre allowance of candle Mr. Jarette\\'s object was\\r\\nto preserve it against some unforeseen need. He may have thought, too,\\r\\nor half thought, that the darkness would be no worse at one time than\\r\\nanother, and if the situation became insupportable it would be better to\\r\\nhave a means of relief, or even release. At any rate it was wise to have\\r\\na little reserve of light, even if only to enable him to look at his\\r\\nwatch.\\r\\n\\r\\nNo sooner had he blown out the candle and set it on the floor at his\\r\\nside than he settled himself comfortably in the arm-chair, leaned back\\r\\nand closed his eyes, hoping and expecting to sleep. In this he was\\r\\ndisappointed; he had never in his life felt less sleepy, and in a few\\r\\nminutes he gave up the attempt. But what could he do? He could not go\\r\\ngroping about in absolute darkness at the risk of bruising himself--at\\r\\nthe risk, too, of blundering against the table and rudely disturbing the\\r\\ndead. We all recognize their right to lie at rest, with immunity from\\r\\nall that is harsh and violent. Jarette almost succeeded in making\\r\\nhimself believe that considerations of this kind restrained him from\\r\\nrisking the collision and fixed him to the chair.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile thinking of this matter he fancied that he heard a faint sound in\\r\\nthe direction of the table--what kind of sound he could hardly have\\r\\nexplained. He did not turn his head. Why should he--in the darkness? But\\r\\nhe listened--why should he not? And listening he grew giddy and grasped\\r\\nthe arms of the chair for support. There was a strange ringing in his\\r\\nears; his head seemed bursting; his chest was oppressed by the\\r\\nconstriction of his clothing. He wondered why it was so, and whether\\r\\nthese were symptoms of fear. Then, with a long and strong expiration,\\r\\nhis chest appeared to collapse, and with the great gasp with which he\\r\\nrefilled his exhausted lungs the vertigo left him and he knew that so\\r\\nintently had he listened that he had held his breath almost to\\r\\nsuffocation. The revelation was vexatious; he arose, pushed away the\\r\\nchair with his foot and strode to the centre of the room. But one does\\r\\nnot stride far in darkness; he began to grope, and finding the wall\\r\\nfollowed it to an angle, turned, followed it past the two windows and\\r\\nthere in another corner came into violent contact with the\\r\\nreading-stand, overturning it. It made a clatter that startled him. He\\r\\nwas annoyed. \"How the devil could I have forgotten where it was?\" he\\r\\nmuttered, and groped his way along the third wall to the fireplace. \"I\\r\\nmust put things to rights,\" said he, feeling the floor for the candle.\\r\\n\\r\\nHaving recovered that, he lighted it and instantly turned his eyes to\\r\\nthe table, where, naturally, nothing had undergone any change. The\\r\\nreading-stand lay unobserved upon the floor: he had forgotten to \"put it\\r\\nto rights.\" He looked all about the room, dispersing the deeper shadows\\r\\nby movements of the candle in his hand, and crossing over to the door\\r\\ntested it by turning and pulling the knob with all his strength. It did\\r\\nnot yield and this seemed to afford him a certain satisfaction; indeed,\\r\\nhe secured it more firmly by a bolt which he had not before observed.\\r\\nReturning to his chair, he looked at his watch; it was half-past nine.\\r\\nWith a start of surprise he held the watch at his ear. It had not\\r\\nstopped. The candle was now visibly shorter. He again extinguished it,\\r\\nplacing it on the floor at his side as before.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Jarette was not at his ease; he was distinctly dissatisfied with his\\r\\nsurroundings, and with himself for being so. \"What have I to fear?\" he\\r\\nthought. \"This is ridiculous and disgraceful; I will not be so great a\\r\\nfool.\" But courage does not come of saying, \"I will be courageous,\" nor\\r\\nof recognizing its appropriateness to the occasion. The more Jarette\\r\\ncondemned himself, the more reason he gave himself for condemnation; the\\r\\ngreater the number of variations which he played upon the simple theme\\r\\nof the harmlessness of the dead, the more insupportable grew the discord\\r\\nof his emotions. \"What!\" he cried aloud in the anguish of his spirit,\\r\\n\"what! shall I, who have not a shade of superstition in my nature--I,\\r\\nwho have no belief in immortality--I, who know (and never more clearly\\r\\nthan now) that the after-life is the dream of a desire--shall I lose at\\r\\nonce my bet, my honor and my self-respect, perhaps my reason, because\\r\\ncertain savage ancestors dwelling in caves and burrows conceived the\\r\\nmonstrous notion that the dead walk by night?--that--\" Distinctly,\\r\\nunmistakably, Mr. Jarette heard behind him a light, soft sound of\\r\\nfootfalls, deliberate, regular, successively nearer!\\r\\n\\r\\nIV\\r\\n\\r\\nJust before daybreak the next morning Dr. Helberson and his young\\r\\nfriend Harper were driving slowly through the streets of North Beach in\\r\\nthe doctor\\'s coup\\xc3\\xa9.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Have you still the confidence of youth in the courage or stolidity of\\r\\nyour friend?\" said the elder man. \"Do you believe that I have lost this\\r\\nwager?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I _know_ you have,\" replied the other, with enfeebling emphasis.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, upon my soul, I hope so.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was spoken earnestly, almost solemnly. There was a silence for a few\\r\\nmoments.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Harper,\" the doctor resumed, looking very serious in the shifting\\r\\nhalf-lights that entered the carriage as they passed the street lamps,\\r\\n\"I don\\'t feel altogether comfortable about this business. If your friend\\r\\nhad not irritated me by the contemptuous manner in which he treated my\\r\\ndoubt of his endurance--a purely physical quality--and by the cool\\r\\nincivility of his suggestion that the corpse be that of a physician, I\\r\\nshould not have gone on with it. If anything should happen we are\\r\\nruined, as I fear we deserve to be.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What can happen? Even if the matter should be taking a serious turn, of\\r\\nwhich I am not at all afraid, Mancher has only to \\'resurrect\\' himself\\r\\nand explain matters. With a genuine \\'subject\\' from the dissecting-room,\\r\\nor one of your late patients, it might be different.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nDr. Mancher, then, had been as good as his promise; he was the \"corpse.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nDr. Helberson was silent for a long time, as the carriage, at a snail\\'s\\r\\npace, crept along the same street it had traveled two or three times\\r\\nalready. Presently he spoke: \"Well, let us hope that Mancher, if he has\\r\\nhad to rise from the dead, has been discreet about it. A mistake in that\\r\\nmight make matters worse instead of better.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes,\" said Harper, \"Jarette would kill him. But, Doctor\"--looking at\\r\\nhis watch as the carriage passed a gas lamp--\"it is nearly four o\\'clock\\r\\nat last.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nA moment later the two had quitted the vehicle and were walking briskly\\r\\ntoward the long-unoccupied house belonging to the doctor in which they\\r\\nhad immured Mr. Jarette in accordance with the terms of the mad wager.\\r\\nAs they neared it they met a man running. \"Can you tell me,\" he cried,\\r\\nsuddenly checking his speed, \"where I can find a doctor?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What\\'s the matter?\" Helberson asked, non-committal.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Go and see for yourself,\" said the man, resuming his running.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey hastened on. Arrived at the house, they saw several persons\\r\\nentering in haste and excitement. In some of the dwellings near by and\\r\\nacross the way the chamber windows were thrown up, showing a protrusion\\r\\nof heads. All heads were asking questions, none heeding the questions of\\r\\nthe others. A few of the windows with closed blinds were illuminated;\\r\\nthe inmates of those rooms were dressing to come down. Exactly opposite\\r\\nthe door of the house that they sought a street lamp threw a yellow,\\r\\ninsufficient light upon the scene, seeming to say that it could disclose\\r\\na good deal more if it wished. Harper paused at the door and laid a hand\\r\\nupon his companion\\'s arm. \"It is all up with us, Doctor,\" he said in\\r\\nextreme agitation, which contrasted strangely with his free-and-easy\\r\\nwords; \"the game has gone against us all. Let\\'s not go in there; I\\'m for\\r\\nlying low.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I\\'m a physician,\" said Dr. Helberson, calmly; \"there may be need of\\r\\none.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThey mounted the doorsteps and were about to enter. The door was open;\\r\\nthe street lamp opposite lighted the passage into which it opened. It\\r\\nwas full of men. Some had ascended the stairs at the farther end, and,\\r\\ndenied admittance above, waited for better fortune. All were talking,\\r\\nnone listening. Suddenly, on the upper landing there was a great\\r\\ncommotion; a man had sprung out of a door and was breaking away from\\r\\nthose endeavoring to detain him. Down through the mass of affrighted\\r\\nidlers he came, pushing them aside, flattening them against the wall on\\r\\none side, or compelling them to cling to the rail on the other,\\r\\nclutching them by the throat, striking them savagely, thrusting them\\r\\nback down the stairs and walking over the fallen. His clothing was in\\r\\ndisorder, he was without a hat. His eyes, wild and restless, had in them\\r\\nsomething more terrifying than his apparently superhuman strength. His\\r\\nface, smooth-shaven, was bloodless, his hair frost-white.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs the crowd at the foot of the stairs, having more freedom, fell away\\r\\nto let him pass Harper sprang forward. \"Jarette! Jarette!\" he cried.\\r\\n\\r\\nDr. Helberson seized Harper by the collar and dragged him back. The man\\r\\nlooked into their faces without seeming to see them and sprang through\\r\\nthe door, down the steps, into the street, and away. A stout policeman,\\r\\nwho had had inferior success in conquering his way down the stairway,\\r\\nfollowed a moment later and started in pursuit, all the heads in the\\r\\nwindows--those of women and children now--screaming in guidance.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe stairway being now partly cleared, most of the crowd having rushed\\r\\ndown to the street to observe the flight and pursuit, Dr. Helberson\\r\\nmounted to the landing, followed by Harper. At a door in the upper\\r\\npassage an officer denied them admittance. \"We are physicians,\" said the\\r\\ndoctor, and they passed in. The room was full of men, dimly seen,\\r\\ncrowded about a table. The newcomers edged their way forward and looked\\r\\nover the shoulders of those in the front rank. Upon the table, the lower\\r\\nlimbs covered with a sheet, lay the body of a man, brilliantly\\r\\nilluminated by the beam of a bull\\'s-eye lantern held by a policeman\\r\\nstanding at the feet. The others, excepting those near the head--the\\r\\nofficer himself--all were in darkness. The face of the body showed\\r\\nyellow, repulsive, horrible! The eyes were partly open and upturned and\\r\\nthe jaw fallen; traces of froth defiled the lips, the chin, the cheeks.\\r\\nA tall man, evidently a doctor, bent over the body with his hand thrust\\r\\nunder the shirt front. He withdrew it and placed two fingers in the open\\r\\nmouth. \"This man has been about six hours dead,\" said he. \"It is a case\\r\\nfor the coroner.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe drew a card from his pocket, handed it to the officer and made his\\r\\nway toward the door.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Clear the room--out, all!\" said the officer, sharply, and the body\\r\\ndisappeared as if it had been snatched away, as shifting the lantern he\\r\\nflashed its beam of light here and there against the faces of the crowd.\\r\\nThe effect was amazing! The men, blinded, confused, almost terrified,\\r\\nmade a tumultuous rush for the door, pushing, crowding, and tumbling\\r\\nover one another as they fled, like the hosts of Night before the shafts\\r\\nof Apollo. Upon the struggling, trampling mass the officer poured his\\r\\nlight without pity and without cessation. Caught in the current,\\r\\nHelberson and Harper were swept out of the room and cascaded down the\\r\\nstairs into the street.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Good God, Doctor! did I not tell you that Jarette would kill him?\" said\\r\\nHarper, as soon as they were clear of the crowd.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I believe you did,\" replied the other, without apparent emotion.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey walked on in silence, block after block. Against the graying east\\r\\nthe dwellings of the hill tribes showed in silhouette. The familiar milk\\r\\nwagon was already astir in the streets; the baker\\'s man would soon come\\r\\nupon the scene; the newspaper carrier was abroad in the land.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It strikes me, youngster,\" said Helberson, \"that you and I have been\\r\\nhaving too much of the morning air lately. It is unwholesome; we need a\\r\\nchange. What do you say to a tour in Europe?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"When?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I\\'m not particular. I should suppose that four o\\'clock this afternoon\\r\\nwould be early enough.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I\\'ll meet you at the boat,\" said Harper.\\r\\n\\r\\nSeven years afterward these two men sat upon a bench in Madison Square,\\r\\nNew York, in familiar conversation. Another man, who had been observing\\r\\nthem for some time, himself unobserved, approached and, courteously\\r\\nlifting his hat from locks as white as frost, said: \"I beg your pardon,\\r\\ngentlemen, but when you have killed a man by coming to life, it is best\\r\\nto change clothes with him, and at the first opportunity make a break\\r\\nfor liberty.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHelberson and Harper exchanged significant glances. They were obviously\\r\\namused. The former then looked the stranger kindly in the eye and\\r\\nreplied:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That has always been my plan. I entirely agree with you as to its\\r\\nadvant--\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe stopped suddenly, rose and went white. He stared at the man,\\r\\nopen-mouthed; he trembled visibly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ah!\" said the stranger, \"I see that you are indisposed, Doctor. If you\\r\\ncannot treat yourself Dr. Harper can do something for you, I am sure.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Who the devil are you?\" said Harper, bluntly.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe stranger came nearer and, bending toward them, said in a whisper: \"I\\r\\ncall myself Jarette sometimes, but I don\\'t mind telling you, for old\\r\\nfriendship, that I am Dr. William Mancher.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe revelation brought Harper to his feet. \"Mancher!\" he cried; and\\r\\nHelberson added: \"It is true, by God!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes,\" said the stranger, smiling vaguely, \"it is true enough, no\\r\\ndoubt.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe hesitated and seemed to be trying to recall something, then began\\r\\nhumming a popular air. He had apparently forgotten their presence.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Look here, Mancher,\" said the elder of the two, \"tell us just what\\r\\noccurred that night--to Jarette, you know.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, yes, about Jarette,\" said the other. \"It\\'s odd I should have\\r\\nneglected to tell you--I tell it so often. You see I knew, by\\r\\nover-hearing him talking to himself, that he was pretty badly\\r\\nfrightened. So I couldn\\'t resist the temptation to come to life and have\\r\\na bit of fun out of him--I couldn\\'t really. That was all right, though\\r\\ncertainly I did not think he would take it so seriously; I did not,\\r\\ntruly. And afterward--well, it was a tough job changing places with him,\\r\\nand then--damn you! you didn\\'t let me out!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nNothing could exceed the ferocity with which these last words were\\r\\ndelivered. Both men stepped back in alarm.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We?--why--why,\" Helberson stammered, losing his self-possession\\r\\nutterly, \"we had nothing to do with it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Didn\\'t I say you were Drs. Hell-born and Sharper?\" inquired the man,\\r\\nlaughing.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My name is Helberson, yes; and this gentleman is Mr. Harper,\" replied\\r\\nthe former, reassured by the laugh. \"But we are not physicians now; we\\r\\nare--well, hang it, old man, we are gamblers.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd that was the truth.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"A very good profession--very good, indeed; and, by the way, I hope\\r\\nSharper here paid over Jarette\\'s money like an honest stakeholder. A\\r\\nvery good and honorable profession,\" he repeated, thoughtfully, moving\\r\\ncarelessly away; \"but I stick to the old one. I am High Supreme Medical\\r\\nOfficer of the Bloomingdale Asylum; it is my duty to cure the\\r\\nsuperintendent.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE MAN AND THE SNAKE\\r\\n\\r\\n  It is of veritabyll report, and attested of so many that there be nowe\\r\\n  of wyse and learned none to gaynsaye it, that y\\'e serpente hys eye\\r\\n  hath a magnetick propertie that whosoe falleth into its svasion is\\r\\n  drawn forwards in despyte of his wille, and perisheth miserabyll by\\r\\n  y\\'e creature hys byte.\\r\\n\\r\\nStretched at ease upon a sofa, in gown and slippers, Harker Brayton\\r\\nsmiled as he read the foregoing sentence in old Morryster\\'s _Marvells of\\r\\nScience._ \"The only marvel in the matter,\" he said to himself, \"is that\\r\\nthe wise and learned in Morryster\\'s day should have believed such\\r\\nnonsense as is rejected by most of even the ignorant in ours.\" A train\\r\\nof reflection followed--for Brayton was a man of thought--and he\\r\\nunconsciously lowered his book without altering the direction of his\\r\\neyes. As soon as the volume had gone below the line of sight, something\\r\\nin an obscure corner of the room recalled his attention to his\\r\\nsurroundings. What he saw, in the shadow under his bed, was two small\\r\\npoints of light, apparently about an inch apart. They might have been\\r\\nreflections of the gas jet above him, in metal nail heads; he gave them\\r\\nbut little thought and resumed his reading. A moment later something--\\r\\nsome impulse which it did not occur to him to analyze--impelled him to\\r\\nlower the book again and seek for what he saw before. The points of\\r\\nlight were still there. They seemed to have become brighter than before,\\r\\nshining with a greenish lustre that he had not at first observed. He\\r\\nthought, too, that they might have moved a trifle--were somewhat nearer.\\r\\nThey were still too much in shadow, however, to reveal their nature and\\r\\norigin to an indolent attention, and again he resumed his reading.\\r\\nSuddenly something in the text suggested a thought that made him start\\r\\nand drop the book for the third time to the side of the sofa, whence,\\r\\nescaping from his hand, it fell sprawling to the floor, back upward.\\r\\nBrayton, half-risen, was staring intently into the obscurity beneath the\\r\\nbed, where the points of light shone with, it seemed to him, an added\\r\\nfire. His attention was now fully aroused, his gaze eager and\\r\\nimperative. It disclosed, almost directly under the foot-rail of the\\r\\nbed, the coils of a large serpent--the points of light were its eyes!\\r\\nIts horrible head, thrust flatly forth from the innermost coil and\\r\\nresting upon the outermost, was directed straight toward him, the\\r\\ndefinition of the wide, brutal jaw and the idiot-like forehead serving\\r\\nto show the direction of its malevolent gaze. The eyes were no longer\\r\\nmerely luminous points; they looked into his own with a meaning, a\\r\\nmalign significance.\\r\\n\\r\\nII\\r\\n\\r\\nA snake in a bedroom of a modern city dwelling of the better sort is,\\r\\nhappily, not so common a phenomenon as to make explanation altogether\\r\\nneedless. Harker Brayton, a bachelor of thirty-five, a scholar, idler\\r\\nand something of an athlete, rich, popular and of sound health, had\\r\\nreturned to San Francisco from all manner of remote and unfamiliar\\r\\ncountries. His tastes, always a trifle luxurious, had taken on an added\\r\\nexuberance from long privation; and the resources of even the Castle\\r\\nHotel being inadequate to their perfect gratification, he had gladly\\r\\naccepted the hospitality of his friend, Dr. Druring, the distinguished\\r\\nscientist. Dr. Druring\\'s house, a large, old-fashioned one in what is\\r\\nnow an obscure quarter of the city, had an outer and visible aspect of\\r\\nproud reserve. It plainly would not associate with the contiguous\\r\\nelements of its altered environment, and appeared to have developed some\\r\\nof the eccentricities which come of isolation. One of these was a\\r\\n\"wing,\" conspicuously irrelevant in point of architecture, and no less\\r\\nrebellious in matter of purpose; for it was a combination of laboratory,\\r\\nmenagerie and museum. It was here that the doctor indulged the\\r\\nscientific side of his nature in the study of such forms of animal life\\r\\nas engaged his interest and comforted his taste--which, it must be\\r\\nconfessed, ran rather to the lower types. For one of the higher nimbly\\r\\nand sweetly to recommend itself unto his gentle senses it had at least\\r\\nto retain certain rudimentary characteristics allying it to such\\r\\n\"dragons of the prime\" as toads and snakes. His scientific sympathies\\r\\nwere distinctly reptilian; he loved nature\\'s vulgarians and described\\r\\nhimself as the Zola of zo\\xc3\\xb6logy. His wife and daughters not having the\\r\\nadvantage to share his enlightened curiosity regarding the works and\\r\\nways of our ill-starred fellow-creatures, were with needless austerity\\r\\nexcluded from what he called the Snakery and doomed to companionship\\r\\nwith their own kind, though to soften the rigors of their lot he had\\r\\npermitted them out of his great wealth to outdo the reptiles in the\\r\\ngorgeousness of their surroundings and to shine with a superior\\r\\nsplendor.\\r\\n\\r\\nArchitecturally and in point of \"furnishing\" the Snakery had a severe\\r\\nsimplicity befitting the humble circumstances of its occupants, many of\\r\\nwhom, indeed, could not safely have been intrusted with the liberty that\\r\\nis necessary to the full enjoyment of luxury, for they had the\\r\\ntroublesome peculiarity of being alive. In their own apartments,\\r\\nhowever, they were under as little personal restraint as was compatible\\r\\nwith their protection from the baneful habit of swallowing one another;\\r\\nand, as Brayton had thoughtfully been apprised, it was more than a\\r\\ntradition that some of them had at divers times been found in parts of\\r\\nthe premises where it would have embarrassed them to explain their\\r\\npresence. Despite the Snakery and its uncanny associations--to which,\\r\\nindeed, he gave little attention--Brayton found life at the Druring\\r\\nmansion very much to his mind.\\r\\n\\r\\nIII\\r\\n\\r\\nBeyond a smart shock of surprise and a shudder of mere loathing Mr.\\r\\nBrayton was not greatly affected. His first thought was to ring the call\\r\\nbell and bring a servant; but although the bell cord dangled within easy\\r\\nreach he made no movement toward it; it had occurred to his mind that\\r\\nthe act might subject him to the suspicion of fear, which he certainly\\r\\ndid not feel. He was more keenly conscious of the incongruous nature of\\r\\nthe situation than affected by its perils; it was revolting, but absurd.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe reptile was of a species with which Brayton was unfamiliar. Its\\r\\nlength he could only conjecture; the body at the largest visible part\\r\\nseemed about as thick as his forearm. In what way was it dangerous, if\\r\\nin any way? Was it venomous? Was it a constrictor? His knowledge of\\r\\nnature\\'s danger signals did not enable him to say; he had never\\r\\ndeciphered the code.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf not dangerous the creature was at least offensive. It was _de trop_--\\r\\n\"matter out of place\"--an impertinence. The gem was unworthy of the\\r\\nsetting. Even the barbarous taste of our time and country, which had\\r\\nloaded the walls of the room with pictures, the floor with furniture and\\r\\nthe furniture with bric-a-brac, had not quite fitted the place for this\\r\\nbit of the savage life of the jungle. Besides--insupportable thought!--\\r\\nthe exhalations of its breath mingled with the atmosphere which he\\r\\nhimself was breathing.\\r\\n\\r\\nThese thoughts shaped themselves with greater or less definition in\\r\\nBrayton\\'s mind and begot action. The process is what we call\\r\\nconsideration and decision. It is thus that we are wise and unwise. It\\r\\nis thus that the withered leaf in an autumn breeze shows greater or less\\r\\nintelligence than its fellows, falling upon the land or upon the lake.\\r\\nThe secret of human action is an open one: something contracts our\\r\\nmuscles. Does it matter if we give to the preparatory molecular changes\\r\\nthe name of will?\\r\\n\\r\\nBrayton rose to his feet and prepared to back softly away from the\\r\\nsnake, without disturbing it if possible, and through the door. Men\\r\\nretire so from the presence of the great, for greatness is power and\\r\\npower is a menace. He knew that he could walk backward without error.\\r\\nShould the monster follow, the taste which had plastered the walls with\\r\\npaintings had consistently supplied a rack of murderous Oriental weapons\\r\\nfrom which he could snatch one to suit the occasion. In the mean time\\r\\nthe snake\\'s eyes burned with a more pitiless malevolence than before.\\r\\n\\r\\nBrayton lifted his right foot free of the floor to step backward. That\\r\\nmoment he felt a strong aversion to doing so.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am accounted brave,\" he thought; \"is bravery, then, no more than\\r\\npride? Because there are none to witness the shame shall I retreat?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was steadying himself with his right hand upon the back of a chair,\\r\\nhis foot suspended.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Nonsense!\" he said aloud; \"I am not so great a coward as to fear to\\r\\nseem to myself afraid.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe lifted the foot a little higher by slightly bending the knee and\\r\\nthrust it sharply to the floor--an inch in front of the other! He could\\r\\nnot think how that occurred. A trial with the left foot had the same\\r\\nresult; it was again in advance of the right. The hand upon the chair\\r\\nback was grasping it; the arm was straight, reaching somewhat backward.\\r\\nOne might have said that he was reluctant to lose his hold. The snake\\'s\\r\\nmalignant head was still thrust forth from the inner coil as before, the\\r\\nneck level. It had not moved, but its eyes were now electric sparks,\\r\\nradiating an infinity of luminous needles.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe man had an ashy pallor. Again he took a step forward, and another,\\r\\npartly dragging the chair, which when finally released fell upon the\\r\\nfloor with a crash. The man groaned; the snake made neither sound nor\\r\\nmotion, but its eyes were two dazzling suns. The reptile itself was\\r\\nwholly concealed by them. They gave off enlarging rings of rich and\\r\\nvivid colors, which at their greatest expansion successively vanished\\r\\nlike soap-bubbles; they seemed to approach his very face, and anon were\\r\\nan immeasurable distance away. He heard, somewhere, the continuous\\r\\nthrobbing of a great drum, with desultory bursts of far music,\\r\\ninconceivably sweet, like the tones of an \\xc3\\xa6olian harp. He knew it for\\r\\nthe sunrise melody of Memnon\\'s statue, and thought he stood in the\\r\\nNileside reeds hearing with exalted sense that immortal anthem through\\r\\nthe silence of the centuries.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe music ceased; rather, it became by insensible degrees the distant\\r\\nroll of a retreating thunder-storm. A landscape, glittering with sun and\\r\\nrain, stretched before him, arched with a vivid rainbow framing in its\\r\\ngiant curve a hundred visible cities. In the middle distance a vast\\r\\nserpent, wearing a crown, reared its head out of its voluminous\\r\\nconvolutions and looked at him with his dead mother\\'s eyes. Suddenly\\r\\nthis enchanting landscape seemed to rise swiftly upward like the drop\\r\\nscene at a theatre, and vanished in a blank. Something struck him a hard\\r\\nblow upon the face and breast. He had fallen to the floor; the blood ran\\r\\nfrom his broken nose and his bruised lips. For a time he was dazed and\\r\\nstunned, and lay with closed eyes, his face against the floor. In a few\\r\\nmoments he had recovered, and then knew that this fall, by withdrawing\\r\\nhis eyes, had broken the spell that held him. He felt that now, by\\r\\nkeeping his gaze averted, he would be able to retreat. But the thought\\r\\nof the serpent within a few feet of his head, yet unseen--perhaps in the\\r\\nvery act of springing upon him and throwing its coils about his throat--\\r\\nwas too horrible! He lifted his head, stared again into those baleful\\r\\neyes and was again in bondage.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe snake had not moved and appeared somewhat to have lost its power\\r\\nupon the imagination; the gorgeous illusions of a few moments before\\r\\nwere not repeated. Beneath that flat and brainless brow its black, beady\\r\\neyes simply glittered as at first with an expression unspeakably\\r\\nmalignant. It was as if the creature, assured of its triumph, had\\r\\ndetermined to practise no more alluring wiles.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow ensued a fearful scene. The man, prone upon the floor, within a yard\\r\\nof his enemy, raised the upper part of his body upon his elbows, his\\r\\nhead thrown back, his legs extended to their full length. His face was\\r\\nwhite between its stains of blood; his eyes were strained open to their\\r\\nuttermost expansion. There was froth upon his lips; it dropped off in\\r\\nflakes. Strong convulsions ran through his body, making almost\\r\\nserpentile undulations. He bent himself at the waist, shifting his legs\\r\\nfrom side to side. And every movement left him a little nearer to the\\r\\nsnake. He thrust his hands forward to brace himself back, yet constantly\\r\\nadvanced upon his elbows.\\r\\n\\r\\nIV\\r\\n\\r\\nDr. Druring and his wife sat in the library. The scientist was in rare\\r\\ngood humor.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have just obtained by exchange with another collector,\" he said, \"a\\r\\nsplendid specimen of the _ophiophagus_.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And what may that be?\" the lady inquired with a somewhat languid\\r\\ninterest.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why, bless my soul, what profound ignorance! My dear, a man who\\r\\nascertains after marriage that his wife does not know Greek is entitled\\r\\nto a divorce. The _ophiophagus_ is a snake that eats other snakes.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I hope it will eat all yours,\" she said, absently shifting the lamp.\\r\\n\"But how does it get the other snakes? By charming them, I suppose.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That is just like you, dear,\" said the doctor, with an affectation of\\r\\npetulance. \"You know how irritating to me is any allusion to that vulgar\\r\\nsuperstition about a snake\\'s power of fascination.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe conversation was interrupted by a mighty cry, which rang through the\\r\\nsilent house like the voice of a demon shouting in a tomb! Again and yet\\r\\nagain it sounded, with terrible distinctness. They sprang to their feet,\\r\\nthe man confused, the lady pale and speechless with fright. Almost\\r\\nbefore the echoes of the last cry had died away the doctor was out of\\r\\nthe room, springing up the stairs two steps at a time. In the corridor\\r\\nin front of Brayton\\'s chamber he met some servants who had come from the\\r\\nupper floor. Together they rushed at the door without knocking. It was\\r\\nunfastened and gave way. Brayton lay upon his stomach on the floor,\\r\\ndead. His head and arms were partly concealed under the foot rail of the\\r\\nbed. They pulled the body away, turning it upon the back. The face was\\r\\ndaubed with blood and froth, the eyes were wide open, staring--a\\r\\ndreadful sight!\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Died in a fit,\" said the scientist, bending his knee and placing his\\r\\nhand upon the heart. While in that position, he chanced to look under\\r\\nthe bed. \"Good God!\" he added, \"how did this thing get in here?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe reached under the bed, pulled out the snake and flung it, still\\r\\ncoiled, to the center of the room, whence with a harsh, shuffling sound\\r\\nit slid across the polished floor till stopped by the wall, where it lay\\r\\nwithout motion. It was a stuffed snake; its eyes were two shoe buttons.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA HOLY TERROR\\r\\n\\r\\nI\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was an entire lack of interest in the latest arrival at\\r\\nHurdy-Gurdy. He was not even christened with the picturesquely\\r\\ndescriptive nick-name which is so frequently a mining camp\\'s word of\\r\\nwelcome to the newcomer. In almost any other camp thereabout this\\r\\ncircumstance would of itself have secured him some such appellation as\\r\\n\"The White-headed Conundrum,\" or \"No Sarvey\"--an expression naively\\r\\nsupposed to suggest to quick intelligences the Spanish _quien sabe_. He\\r\\ncame without provoking a ripple of concern upon the social surface of\\r\\nHurdy-Gurdy--a place which to the general Californian contempt of men\\'s\\r\\npersonal history superadded a local indifference of its own. The time\\r\\nwas long past when it was of any importance who came there, or if\\r\\nanybody came. No one was living at Hurdy-Gurdy.\\r\\n\\r\\nTwo years before, the camp had boasted a stirring population of two or\\r\\nthree thousand males and not fewer than a dozen females. A majority of\\r\\nthe former had done a few weeks\\' earnest work in demonstrating, to the\\r\\ndisgust of the latter, the singularly mendacious character of the person\\r\\nwhose ingenious tales of rich gold deposits had lured them thither--\\r\\nwork, by the way, in which there was as little mental satisfaction as\\r\\npecuniary profit; for a bullet from the pistol of a public-spirited\\r\\ncitizen had put that imaginative gentleman beyond the reach of aspersion\\r\\non the third day of the camp\\'s existence. Still, his fiction had a\\r\\ncertain foundation in fact, and many had lingered a considerable time in\\r\\nand about Hurdy-Gurdy, though now all had been long gone.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut they had left ample evidence of their sojourn. From the point where\\r\\nInjun Creek falls into the Rio San Juan Smith, up along both banks of\\r\\nthe former into the ca\\xc3\\xb1on whence it emerges, extended a double row of\\r\\nforlorn shanties that seemed about to fall upon one another\\'s neck to\\r\\nbewail their desolation; while about an equal number appeared to have\\r\\nstraggled up the slope on either hand and perched themselves upon\\r\\ncommanding eminences, whence they craned forward to get a good view of\\r\\nthe affecting scene. Most of these habitations were emaciated as by\\r\\nfamine to the condition of mere skeletons, about which clung unlovely\\r\\ntatters of what might have been skin, but was really canvas. The little\\r\\nvalley itself, torn and gashed by pick and shovel, was unhandsome with\\r\\nlong, bending lines of decaying flume resting here and there upon the\\r\\nsummits of sharp ridges, and stilting awkwardly across the intervals\\r\\nupon unhewn poles. The whole place presented that raw and forbidding\\r\\naspect of arrested development which is a new country\\'s substitute for\\r\\nthe solemn grace of ruin wrought by time. Wherever there remained a\\r\\npatch of the original soil a rank overgrowth of weeds and brambles had\\r\\nspread upon the scene, and from its dank, unwholesome shades the visitor\\r\\ncurious in such matters might have obtained numberless souvenirs of the\\r\\ncamp\\'s former glory--fellowless boots mantled with green mould and\\r\\nplethoric of rotting leaves; an occasional old felt hat; desultory\\r\\nremnants of a flannel shirt; sardine boxes inhumanly mutilated and a\\r\\nsurprising profusion of black bottles distributed with a truly catholic\\r\\nimpartiality, everywhere.\\r\\n\\r\\nII\\r\\n\\r\\nThe man who had now rediscovered Hurdy-Gurdy was evidently not curious\\r\\nas to its arch\\xc3\\xa6ology. Nor, as he looked about him upon the dismal\\r\\nevidences of wasted work and broken hopes, their dispiriting\\r\\nsignificance accentuated by the ironical pomp of a cheap gilding by the\\r\\nrising sun, did he supplement his sigh of weariness by one of\\r\\nsensibility. He simply removed from the back of his tired burro a\\r\\nminer\\'s outfit a trifle larger than the animal itself, picketed that\\r\\ncreature and selecting a hatchet from his kit moved off at once across\\r\\nthe dry bed of Injun Creek to the top of a low, gravelly hill beyond.\\r\\n\\r\\nStepping across a prostrate fence of brush and boards he picked up one\\r\\nof the latter, split it into five parts and sharpened them at one end.\\r\\nHe then began a kind of search, occasionally stooping to examine\\r\\nsomething with close attention. At last his patient scrutiny appeared to\\r\\nbe rewarded with success, for he suddenly erected his figure to its full\\r\\nheight, made a gesture of satisfaction, pronounced the word \"Scarry\" and\\r\\nat once strode away with long, equal steps, which he counted. Then he\\r\\nstopped and drove one of his stakes into the earth. He then looked\\r\\ncarefully about him, measured off a number of paces over a singularly\\r\\nuneven ground and hammered in another. Pacing off twice the distance at\\r\\na right angle to his former course he drove down a third, and repeating\\r\\nthe process sank home the fourth, and then a fifth. This he split at the\\r\\ntop and in the cleft inserted an old letter envelope covered with an\\r\\nintricate system of pencil tracks. In short, he staked off a hill claim\\r\\nin strict accordance with the local mining laws of Hurdy-Gurdy and put\\r\\nup the customary notice.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is necessary to explain that one of the adjuncts to Hurdy-Gurdy--one\\r\\nto which that metropolis became afterward itself an adjunct--was a\\r\\ncemetery. In the first week of the camp\\'s existence this had been\\r\\nthoughtfully laid out by a committee of citizens. The day after had been\\r\\nsignalized by a debate between two members of the committee, with\\r\\nreference to a more eligible site, and on the third day the necropolis\\r\\nwas inaugurated by a double funeral. As the camp had waned the cemetery\\r\\nhad waxed; and long before the ultimate inhabitant, victorious alike\\r\\nover the insidious malaria and the forthright revolver, had turned the\\r\\ntail of his pack-ass upon Injun Creek the outlying settlement had become\\r\\na populous if not popular suburb. And now, when the town was fallen into\\r\\nthe sere and yellow leaf of an unlovely senility, the graveyard--though\\r\\nsomewhat marred by time and circumstance, and not altogether exempt from\\r\\ninnovations in grammar and experiments in orthography, to say nothing of\\r\\nthe devastating coyote--answered the humble needs of its denizens with\\r\\nreasonable completeness. It comprised a generous two acres of ground,\\r\\nwhich with commendable thrift but needless care had been selected for\\r\\nits mineral unworth, contained two or three skeleton trees (one of which\\r\\nhad a stout lateral branch from which a weather-wasted rope still\\r\\nsignificantly dangled), half a hundred gravelly mounds, a score of rude\\r\\nheadboards displaying the literary peculiarities above mentioned and a\\r\\nstruggling colony of prickly pears. Altogether, God\\'s Location, as with\\r\\ncharacteristic reverence it had been called, could justly boast of an\\r\\nindubitably superior quality of desolation. It was in the most thickly\\r\\nsettled part of this interesting demesne that Mr. Jefferson Doman staked\\r\\noff his claim. If in the prosecution of his design he should deem it\\r\\nexpedient to remove any of the dead they would have the right to be\\r\\nsuitably reinterred.\\r\\n\\r\\nIII\\r\\n\\r\\nThis Mr. Jefferson Doman was from Elizabethtown, New Jersey, where six\\r\\nyears before he had left his heart in the keeping of a golden-haired,\\r\\ndemure-mannered young woman named Mary Matthews, as collateral security\\r\\nfor his return to claim her hand.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I just _know_ you\\'ll never get back alive--you never do succeed in\\r\\nanything,\" was the remark which illustrated Miss Matthews\\'s notion of\\r\\nwhat constituted success and, inferentially, her view of the nature of\\r\\nencouragement. She added: \"If you don\\'t I\\'ll go to California too. I can\\r\\nput the coins in little bags as you dig them out.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThis characteristically feminine theory of auriferous deposits did not\\r\\ncommend itself to the masculine intelligence: it was Mr. Doman\\'s belief\\r\\nthat gold was found in a liquid state. He deprecated her intent with\\r\\nconsiderable enthusiasm, suppressed her sobs with a light hand upon her\\r\\nmouth, laughed in her eyes as he kissed away her tears, and with a\\r\\ncheerful \"Ta-ta\" went to California to labor for her through the long,\\r\\nloveless years, with a strong heart, an alert hope and a steadfast\\r\\nfidelity that never for a moment forgot what it was about. In the\\r\\nmean time, Miss Matthews had granted a monopoly of her humble talent for\\r\\nsacking up coins to Mr. Jo. Seeman, of New York, gambler, by whom it was\\r\\nbetter appreciated than her commanding genius for unsacking and\\r\\nbestowing them upon his local rivals. Of this latter aptitude, indeed,\\r\\nhe manifested his disapproval by an act which secured him the position\\r\\nof clerk of the laundry in the State prison, and for her the _sobriquet_\\r\\nof \"Split-faced Moll.\" At about this time she wrote to Mr. Doman a\\r\\ntouching letter of renunciation, inclosing her photograph to prove that\\r\\nshe had no longer had a right to indulge the dream of becoming Mrs.\\r\\nDoman, and recounting so graphically her fall from a horse that the\\r\\nstaid \"plug\" upon which Mr. Doman had ridden into Red Dog to get the\\r\\nletter made vicarious atonement under the spur all the way back to camp.\\r\\nThe letter failed in a signal way to accomplish its object; the fidelity\\r\\nwhich had before been to Mr. Doman a matter of love and duty was\\r\\nthenceforth a matter of honor also; and the photograph, showing the once\\r\\npretty face sadly disfigured as by the slash of a knife, was duly\\r\\ninstated in his affections and its more comely predecessor treated with\\r\\ncontumelious neglect. On being informed of this, Miss Matthews, it is\\r\\nonly fair to say, appeared less surprised than from the apparently low\\r\\nestimate of Mr. Doman\\'s generosity which the tone of her former letter\\r\\nattested one would naturally have expected her to be. Soon after,\\r\\nhowever, her letters grew infrequent, and then ceased altogether.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut Mr. Doman had another correspondent, Mr. Barney Bree, of\\r\\nHurdy-Gurdy, formerly of Red Dog. This gentleman, although a notable\\r\\nfigure among miners, was not a miner. His knowledge of mining consisted\\r\\nmainly in a marvelous command of its slang, to which he made copious\\r\\ncontributions, enriching its vocabulary with a wealth of uncommon\\r\\nphrases more remarkable for their aptness than their refinement, and\\r\\nwhich impressed the unlearned \"tenderfoot\" with a lively sense of the\\r\\nprofundity of their inventor\\'s acquirements. When not entertaining a\\r\\ncircle of admiring auditors from San Francisco or the East he could\\r\\ncommonly be found pursuing the comparatively obscure industry of\\r\\nsweeping out the various dance houses and purifying the cuspidors.\\r\\n\\r\\nBarney had apparently but two passions in life--love of Jefferson Doman,\\r\\nwho had once been of some service to him, and love of whisky, which\\r\\ncertainly had not. He had been among the first in the rush to\\r\\nHurdy-Gurdy, but had not prospered, and had sunk by degrees to the\\r\\nposition of grave digger. This was not a vocation, but Barney in a\\r\\ndesultory way turned his trembling hand to it whenever some local\\r\\nmisunderstanding at the card table and his own partial recovery from a\\r\\nprolonged debauch occurred coincidently in point of time. One day Mr.\\r\\nDoman received, at Red Dog, a letter with the simple postmark, \"Hurdy,\\r\\nCal.,\" and being occupied with another matter, carelessly thrust it into\\r\\na chink of his cabin for future perusal. Some two years later it was\\r\\naccidentally dislodged and he read it. It ran as follows:--\\r\\n\\r\\n  HURDY, June 6.\\r\\n\\r\\n  FRIEND JEFF: I\\'ve hit her hard in the boneyard. She\\'s blind and lousy.\\r\\n  I\\'m on the divvy--that\\'s me, and mum\\'s my lay till you toot.\\r\\n  Yours, BARNEY.\\r\\n\\r\\n  P.S.--I\\'ve clayed her with Scarry.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith some knowledge of the general mining camp _argot_ and of Mr. Bree\\'s\\r\\nprivate system for the communication of ideas Mr. Doman had no\\r\\ndifficulty in understanding by this uncommon epistle that Barney while\\r\\nperforming his duty as grave digger had uncovered a quartz ledge with no\\r\\noutcroppings; that it was visibly rich in free gold; that, moved by\\r\\nconsiderations of friendship, he was willing to accept Mr. Doman as a\\r\\npartner and awaiting that gentleman\\'s declaration of his will in the\\r\\nmatter would discreetly keep the discovery a secret. From the postscript\\r\\nit was plainly inferable that in order to conceal the treasure he had\\r\\nburied above it the mortal part of a person named Scarry.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom subsequent events, as related to Mr. Doman at Red Dog, it would\\r\\nappear that before taking this precaution Mr. Bree must have had the\\r\\nthrift to remove a modest competency of the gold; at any rate, it was at\\r\\nabout that time that he entered upon that memorable series of potations\\r\\nand treatings which is still one of the cherished traditions of the San\\r\\nJuan Smith country, and is spoken of with respect as far away as Ghost\\r\\nRock and Lone Hand. At its conclusion some former citizens of\\r\\nHurdy-Gurdy, for whom he had performed the last kindly office at the\\r\\ncemetery, made room for him among them, and he rested well.\\r\\n\\r\\nIV\\r\\n\\r\\nHaving finished staking off his claim Mr. Doman walked back to the\\r\\ncentre of it and stood again at the spot where his search among the\\r\\ngraves had expired in the exclamation, \"Scarry.\" He bent again over the\\r\\nheadboard that bore that name and as if to reinforce the senses of sight\\r\\nand hearing ran his forefinger along the rudely carved letters.\\r\\nRe-erecting himself he appended orally to the simple inscription the\\r\\nshockingly forthright epitaph, \"She was a holy terror!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHad Mr. Doman been required to make these words good with proof--as,\\r\\nconsidering their somewhat censorious character, he doubtless should\\r\\nhave been--he would have found himself embarrassed by the absence of\\r\\nreputable witnesses, and hearsay evidence would have been the best he\\r\\ncould command. At the time when Scarry had been prevalent in the mining\\r\\ncamps thereabout--when, as the editor of the _Hurdy Herald_ would have\\r\\nphrased it, she was \"in the plenitude of her power\"--Mr. Doman\\'s\\r\\nfortunes had been at a low ebb, and he had led the vagrantly laborious\\r\\nlife of a prospector. His time had been mostly spent in the mountains,\\r\\nnow with one companion, now with another. It was from the admiring\\r\\nrecitals of these casual partners, fresh from the various camps, that\\r\\nhis judgment of Scarry had been made up; he himself had never had the\\r\\ndoubtful advantage of her acquaintance and the precarious distinction of\\r\\nher favor. And when, finally, on the termination of her perverse career\\r\\nat Hurdy-Gurdy he had read in a chance copy of the _Herald_ her\\r\\ncolumn-long obituary (written by the local humorist of that lively sheet\\r\\nin the highest style of his art) Doman had paid to her memory and to her\\r\\nhistoriographer\\'s genius the tribute of a smile and chivalrously\\r\\nforgotten her. Standing now at the grave-side of this mountain Messalina\\r\\nhe recalled the leading events of her turbulent career, as he had heard\\r\\nthem celebrated at his several campfires, and perhaps with an\\r\\nunconscious attempt at self-justification repeated that she was a holy\\r\\nterror, and sank his pick into her grave up to the handle. At that\\r\\nmoment a raven, which had silently settled upon a branch of the blasted\\r\\ntree above his head, solemnly snapped its beak and uttered its mind\\r\\nabout the matter with an approving croak.\\r\\n\\r\\nPursuing his discovery of free gold with great zeal, which he probably\\r\\ncredited to his conscience as a grave digger, Mr. Barney Bree had made\\r\\nan unusually deep sepulcher, and it was near sunset before Mr. Doman,\\r\\nlaboring with the leisurely deliberation of one who has \"a dead sure\\r\\nthing\" and no fear of an adverse claimant\\'s enforcement of a prior\\r\\nright, reached the coffin and uncovered it. When he had done so he was\\r\\nconfronted by a difficulty for which he had made no provision; the\\r\\ncoffin--a mere flat shell of not very well-preserved redwood boards,\\r\\napparently--had no handles, and it filled the entire bottom of the\\r\\nexcavation. The best he could do without violating the decent sanctities\\r\\nof the situation was to make the excavation sufficiently longer to\\r\\nenable him to stand at the head of the casket and getting his powerful\\r\\nhands underneath erect it upon its narrower end; and this he proceeded\\r\\nto do. The approach of night quickened his efforts. He had no thought of\\r\\nabandoning his task at this stage to resume it on the morrow under more\\r\\nadvantageous conditions. The feverish stimulation of cupidity and the\\r\\nfascination of terror held him to his dismal work with an iron\\r\\nauthority. He no longer idled, but wrought with a terrible zeal. His\\r\\nhead uncovered, his outer garments discarded, his shirt opened at the\\r\\nneck and thrown back from his breast, down which ran sinuous rills of\\r\\nperspiration, this hardy and impenitent gold-getter and grave-robber\\r\\ntoiled with a giant energy that almost dignified the character of his\\r\\nhorrible purpose; and when the sun fringes had burned themselves out\\r\\nalong the crest line of the western hills, and the full moon had climbed\\r\\nout of the shadows that lay along the purple plain, he had erected the\\r\\ncoffin upon its foot, where it stood propped against the end of the open\\r\\ngrave. Then, standing up to his neck in the earth at the opposite\\r\\nextreme of the excavation, as he looked at the coffin upon which the\\r\\nmoonlight now fell with a full illumination he was thrilled with a\\r\\nsudden terror to observe upon it the startling apparition of a dark\\r\\nhuman head--the shadow of his own. For a moment this simple and natural\\r\\ncircumstance unnerved him. The noise of his labored breathing frightened\\r\\nhim, and he tried to still it, but his bursting lungs would not be\\r\\ndenied. Then, laughing half-audibly and wholly without spirit, he began\\r\\nmaking movements of his head from side to side, in order to compel the\\r\\napparition to repeat them. He found a comforting reassurance in\\r\\nasserting his command over his own shadow. He was temporizing, making,\\r\\nwith unconscious prudence, a dilatory opposition to an impending\\r\\ncatastrophe. He felt that invisible forces of evil were closing in upon\\r\\nhim, and he parleyed for time with the Inevitable.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe now observed in succession several unusual circumstances. The surface\\r\\nof the coffin upon which his eyes were fastened was not flat; it\\r\\npresented two distinct ridges, one longitudinal and the other\\r\\ntransverse. Where these intersected at the widest part there was a\\r\\ncorroded metallic plate that reflected the moonlight with a dismal\\r\\nlustre. Along the outer edges of the coffin, at long intervals, were\\r\\nrust-eaten heads of nails. This frail product of the carpenter\\'s art had\\r\\nbeen put into the grave the wrong side up!\\r\\n\\r\\nPerhaps it was one of the humors of the camp--a practical manifestation\\r\\nof the facetious spirit that had found literary expression in the\\r\\ntopsy-turvy obituary notice from the pen of Hurdy-Gurdy\\'s great\\r\\nhumorist. Perhaps it had some occult personal signification impenetrable\\r\\nto understandings uninstructed in local traditions. A more charitable\\r\\nhypothesis is that it was owing to a misadventure on the part of Mr.\\r\\nBarney Bree, who, making the interment unassisted (either by choice for\\r\\nthe conservation of his golden secret, or through public apathy), had\\r\\ncommitted a blunder which he was afterward unable or unconcerned to\\r\\nrectify. However it had come about, poor Scarry had indubitably been put\\r\\ninto the earth face downward.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen terror and absurdity make alliance, the effect is frightful. This\\r\\nstrong-hearted and daring man, this hardy night worker among the dead,\\r\\nthis defiant antagonist of darkness and desolation, succumbed to a\\r\\nridiculous surprise. He was smitten with a thrilling chill--shivered,\\r\\nand shook his massive shoulders as if to throw off an icy hand. He no\\r\\nlonger breathed, and the blood in his veins, unable to abate its\\r\\nimpetus, surged hotly beneath his cold skin. Unleavened with oxygen, it\\r\\nmounted to his head and congested his brain. His physical functions had\\r\\ngone over to the enemy; his very heart was arrayed against him. He did\\r\\nnot move; he could not have cried out. He needed but a coffin to be\\r\\ndead--as dead as the death that confronted him with only the length of\\r\\nan open grave and the thickness of a rotting plank between.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen, one by one, his senses returned; the tide of terror that had\\r\\noverwhelmed his faculties began to recede. But with the return of his\\r\\nsenses he became singularly unconscious of the object of his fear. He\\r\\nsaw the moonlight gilding the coffin, but no longer the coffin that it\\r\\ngilded. Raising his eyes and turning his head, he noted, curiously and\\r\\nwith surprise, the black branches of the dead tree, and tried to\\r\\nestimate the length of the weather-worn rope that dangled from its\\r\\nghostly hand. The monotonous barking of distant coyotes affected him as\\r\\nsomething he had heard years ago in a dream. An owl flapped awkwardly\\r\\nabove him on noiseless wings, and he tried to forecast the direction of\\r\\nits flight when it should encounter the cliff that reared its\\r\\nilluminated front a mile away. His hearing took account of a gopher\\'s\\r\\nstealthy tread in the shadow of the cactus. He was intensely observant;\\r\\nhis senses were all alert; but he saw not the coffin. As one can gaze at\\r\\nthe sun until it looks black and then vanishes, so his mind, having\\r\\nexhausted its capacities of dread, was no longer conscious of the\\r\\nseparate existence of anything dreadful. The Assassin was cloaking the\\r\\nsword.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was during this lull in the battle that he became sensible of a\\r\\nfaint, sickening odor. At first he thought it was that of a\\r\\nrattle-snake, and involuntarily tried to look about his feet. They were\\r\\nnearly invisible in the gloom of the grave. A hoarse, gurgling sound,\\r\\nlike the death-rattle in a human throat, seemed to come out of the sky,\\r\\nand a moment later a great, black, angular shadow, like the same sound\\r\\nmade visible, dropped curving from the topmost branch of the spectral\\r\\ntree, fluttered for an instant before his face and sailed fiercely away\\r\\ninto the mist along the creek.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was the raven. The incident recalled him to a sense of the situation,\\r\\nand again his eyes sought the upright coffin, now illuminated by the\\r\\nmoon for half its length. He saw the gleam of the metallic plate and\\r\\ntried without moving to decipher the inscription. Then he fell to\\r\\nspeculating upon what was behind it. His creative imagination presented\\r\\nhim a vivid picture. The planks no longer seemed an obstacle to his\\r\\nvision and he saw the livid corpse of the dead woman, standing in\\r\\ngrave-clothes, and staring vacantly at him, with lidless, shrunken eyes.\\r\\nThe lower jaw was fallen, the upper lip drawn away from the uncovered\\r\\nteeth. He could make out a mottled pattern on the hollow cheeks--the\\r\\nmaculations of decay. By some mysterious process his mind reverted for\\r\\nthe first time that day to the photograph of Mary Matthews. He\\r\\ncontrasted its blonde beauty with the forbidding aspect of this dead\\r\\nface--the most beloved object that he knew with the most hideous that he\\r\\ncould conceive.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Assassin now advanced and displaying the blade laid it against the\\r\\nvictim\\'s throat. That is to say, the man became at first dimly, then\\r\\ndefinitely, aware of an impressive coincidence--a relation--a parallel\\r\\nbetween the face on the card and the name on the headboard. The one was\\r\\ndisfigured, the other described a disfiguration. The thought took hold\\r\\nof him and shook him. It transformed the face that his imagination had\\r\\ncreated behind the coffin lid; the contrast became a resemblance; the\\r\\nresemblance grew to identity. Remembering the many descriptions of\\r\\nScarry\\'s personal appearance that he had heard from the gossips of his\\r\\ncamp-fire he tried with imperfect success to recall the exact nature of\\r\\nthe disfiguration that had given the woman her ugly name; and what was\\r\\nlacking in his memory fancy supplied, stamping it with the validity of\\r\\nconviction. In the maddening attempt to recall such scraps of the\\r\\nwoman\\'s history as he had heard, the muscles of his arms and hands were\\r\\nstrained to a painful tension, as by an effort to lift a great weight.\\r\\nHis body writhed and twisted with the exertion. The tendons of his neck\\r\\nstood out as tense as whip-cords, and his breath came in short, sharp\\r\\ngasps. The catastrophe could not be much longer delayed, or the agony of\\r\\nanticipation would leave nothing to be done by the _coup de gr\\xc3\\xa2ce_ of\\r\\nverification. The scarred face behind the lid would slay him through the\\r\\nwood.\\r\\n\\r\\nA movement of the coffin diverted his thought. It came forward to within\\r\\na foot of his face, growing visibly larger as it approached. The rusted\\r\\nmetallic plate, with an inscription illegible in the moonlight, looked\\r\\nhim steadily in the eye. Determined not to shrink, he tried to brace his\\r\\nshoulders more firmly against the end of the excavation, and nearly fell\\r\\nbackward in the attempt. There was nothing to support him; he had\\r\\nunconsciously moved upon his enemy, clutching the heavy knife that he\\r\\nhad drawn from his belt. The coffin had not advanced and he smiled to\\r\\nthink it could not retreat. Lifting his knife he struck the heavy hilt\\r\\nagainst the metal plate with all his power. There was a sharp, ringing\\r\\npercussion, and with a dull clatter the whole decayed coffin lid broke\\r\\nin pieces and came away, falling about his feet. The quick and the dead\\r\\nwere face to face--the frenzied, shrieking man--the woman standing\\r\\ntranquil in her silences. She was a holy terror!\\r\\n\\r\\nV\\r\\n\\r\\nSome months later a party of men and women belonging to the highest\\r\\nsocial circles of San Francisco passed through Hurdy-Gurdy on their way\\r\\nto the Yosemite Valley by a new trail. They halted for dinner and during\\r\\nits preparation explored the desolate camp. One of the party had been at\\r\\nHurdy-Gurdy in the days of its glory. He had, indeed, been one of its\\r\\nprominent citizens; and it used to be said that more money passed over\\r\\nhis faro table in any one night than over those of all his competitors\\r\\nin a week; but being now a millionaire engaged in greater enterprises,\\r\\nhe did not deem these early successes of sufficient importance to merit\\r\\nthe distinction of remark. His invalid wife, a lady famous in San\\r\\nFrancisco for the costly nature of her entertainments and her exacting\\r\\nrigor with regard to the social position and \"antecedents\" of those who\\r\\nattended them, accompanied the expedition. During a stroll among the\\r\\nshanties of the abandoned camp Mr. Porfer directed the attention of his\\r\\nwife and friends to a dead tree on a low hill beyond Injun Creek.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"As I told you,\" he said, \"I passed through this camp in 1852, and was\\r\\ntold that no fewer than five men had been hanged here by vigilantes at\\r\\ndifferent times, and all on that tree. If I am not mistaken, a rope is\\r\\ndangling from it yet. Let us go over and see the place.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Porfer did not add that the rope in question was perhaps the very\\r\\none from whose fatal embrace his own neck had once had an escape so\\r\\nnarrow that an hour\\'s delay in taking himself out of that region would\\r\\nhave spanned it.\\r\\n\\r\\nProceeding leisurely down the creek to a convenient crossing, the party\\r\\ncame upon the cleanly picked skeleton of an animal which Mr. Porfer\\r\\nafter due examination pronounced to be that of an ass. The\\r\\ndistinguishing ears were gone, but much of the inedible head had been\\r\\nspared by the beasts and birds, and the stout bridle of horsehair was\\r\\nintact, as was the riata, of similar material, connecting it with a\\r\\npicket pin still firmly sunken in the earth. The wooden and metallic\\r\\nelements of a miner\\'s kit lay near by. The customary remarks were made,\\r\\ncynical on the part of the men, sentimental and refined by the lady. A\\r\\nlittle later they stood by the tree in the cemetery and Mr. Porfer\\r\\nsufficiently unbent from his dignity to place himself beneath the rotten\\r\\nrope and confidently lay a coil of it about his neck, somewhat, it\\r\\nappeared, to his own satisfaction, but greatly to the horror of his\\r\\nwife, to whose sensibilities the performance gave a smart shock.\\r\\n\\r\\nAn exclamation from one of the party gathered them all about an open\\r\\ngrave, at the bottom of which they saw a confused mass of human bones\\r\\nand the broken remnants of a coffin. Coyotes and buzzards had performed\\r\\nthe last sad rites for pretty much all else. Two skulls were visible and\\r\\nin order to investigate this somewhat unusual redundancy one of the\\r\\nyounger men had the hardihood to spring into the grave and hand them up\\r\\nto another before Mrs. Porfer could indicate her marked disapproval of\\r\\nso shocking an act, which, nevertheless, she did with considerable\\r\\nfeeling and in very choice words. Pursuing his search among the dismal\\r\\ndebris at the bottom of the grave the young man next handed up a rusted\\r\\ncoffin plate, with a rudely cut inscription, which with difficulty Mr.\\r\\nPorfer deciphered and read aloud with an earnest and not altogether\\r\\nunsuccessful attempt at the dramatic effect which he deemed befitting to\\r\\nthe occasion and his rhetorical abilities:\\r\\n\\r\\n  MANUELITA MURPHY.\\r\\n  Born at the Mission San Pedro--Died in\\r\\n  Hurdy-Gurdy,\\r\\n  Aged 47.\\r\\n  Hell\\'s full of such.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn deference to the piety of the reader and the nerves of Mrs. Porfer\\'s\\r\\nfastidious sisterhood of both sexes let us not touch upon the painful\\r\\nimpression produced by this uncommon inscription, further than to say\\r\\nthat the elocutionary powers of Mr. Porfer had never before met with so\\r\\nspontaneous and overwhelming recognition.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe next morsel that rewarded the ghoul in the grave was a long tangle\\r\\nof black hair defiled with clay: but this was such an anti-climax that\\r\\nit received little attention. Suddenly, with a short exclamation and a\\r\\ngesture of excitement, the young man unearthed a fragment of grayish\\r\\nrock, and after a hurried inspection handed it up to Mr. Porfer. As the\\r\\nsunlight fell upon it it glittered with a yellow luster--it was thickly\\r\\nstudded with gleaming points. Mr. Porfer snatched it, bent his head over\\r\\nit a moment and threw it lightly away with the simple remark:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Iron pyrites--fool\\'s gold.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe young man in the discovery shaft was a trifle disconcerted,\\r\\napparently.\\r\\n\\r\\nMeanwhile, Mrs. Porfer, unable longer to endure the disagreeable\\r\\nbusiness, had walked back to the tree and seated herself at its root.\\r\\nWhile rearranging a tress of golden hair which had slipped from its\\r\\nconfinement she was attracted by what appeared to be and really was the\\r\\nfragment of an old coat. Looking about to assure herself that so\\r\\nunladylike an act was not observed, she thrust her jeweled hand into the\\r\\nexposed breast pocket and drew out a mouldy pocket-book. Its contents\\r\\nwere as follows:\\r\\n\\r\\nOne bundle of letters, postmarked \"Elizabethtown, New Jersey.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nOne circle of blonde hair tied with a ribbon.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne photograph of a beautiful girl.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne ditto of same, singularly disfigured.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne name on back of photograph--\"Jefferson Doman.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nA few moments later a group of anxious gentlemen surrounded Mrs. Porfer\\r\\nas she sat motionless at the foot of the tree, her head dropped forward,\\r\\nher fingers clutching a crushed photograph. Her husband raised her head,\\r\\nexposing a face ghastly white, except the long, deforming cicatrice,\\r\\nfamiliar to all her friends, which no art could ever hide, and which now\\r\\ntraversed the pallor of her countenance like a visible curse.\\r\\n\\r\\nMary Matthews Porfer had the bad luck to be dead.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE SUITABLE SURROUNDINGS\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE NIGHT\\r\\n\\r\\nOne midsummer night a farmer\\'s boy living about ten miles from the city\\r\\nof Cincinnati was following a bridle path through a dense and dark\\r\\nforest. He had lost himself while searching for some missing cows, and\\r\\nnear midnight was a long way from home, in a part of the country with\\r\\nwhich he was unfamiliar. But he was a stout-hearted lad, and knowing his\\r\\ngeneral direction from his home, he plunged into the forest without\\r\\nhesitation, guided by the stars. Coming into the bridle path, and\\r\\nobserving that it ran in the right direction, he followed it.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe night was clear, but in the woods it was exceedingly dark. It was\\r\\nmore by the sense of touch than by that of sight that the lad kept the\\r\\npath. He could not, indeed, very easily go astray; the undergrowth on\\r\\nboth sides was so thick as to be almost impenetrable. He had gone into\\r\\nthe forest a mile or more when he was surprised to see a feeble gleam of\\r\\nlight shining through the foliage skirting the path on his left. The\\r\\nsight of it startled him and set his heart beating audibly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The old Breede house is somewhere about here,\" he said to himself.\\r\\n\"This must be the other end of the path which we reach it by from our\\r\\nside. Ugh! what should a light be doing there?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nNevertheless, he pushed on. A moment later he had emerged from the\\r\\nforest into a small, open space, mostly upgrown to brambles. There were\\r\\nremnants of a rotting fence. A few yards from the trail, in the middle\\r\\nof the \"clearing,\" was the house from which the light came, through an\\r\\nunglazed window. The window had once contained glass, but that and its\\r\\nsupporting frame had long ago yielded to missiles flung by hands of\\r\\nventuresome boys to attest alike their courage and their hostility to\\r\\nthe supernatural; for the Breede house bore the evil reputation of being\\r\\nhaunted. Possibly it was not, but even the hardiest sceptic could not\\r\\ndeny that it was deserted--which in rural regions is much the same\\r\\nthing.\\r\\n\\r\\nLooking at the mysterious dim light shining from the ruined window the\\r\\nboy remembered with apprehension that his own hand had assisted at the\\r\\ndestruction. His penitence was of course poignant in proportion to its\\r\\ntardiness and inefficacy. He half expected to be set upon by all the\\r\\nunworldly and bodiless malevolences whom he had outraged by assisting to\\r\\nbreak alike their windows and their peace. Yet this stubborn lad,\\r\\nshaking in every limb, would not retreat. The blood in his veins was\\r\\nstrong and rich with the iron of the frontiersman. He was but two\\r\\nremoves from the generation that had subdued the Indian. He started to\\r\\npass the house.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs he was going by he looked in at the blank window space and saw a\\r\\nstrange and terrifying sight,--the figure of a man seated in the centre\\r\\nof the room, at a table upon which lay some loose sheets of paper. The\\r\\nelbows rested on the table, the hands supporting the head, which was\\r\\nuncovered. On each side the fingers were pushed into the hair. The face\\r\\nshowed dead-yellow in the light of a single candle a little to one side.\\r\\nThe flame illuminated that side of the face, the other was in deep\\r\\nshadow. The man\\'s eyes were fixed upon the blank window space with a\\r\\nstare in which an older and cooler observer might have discerned\\r\\nsomething of apprehension, but which seemed to the lad altogether\\r\\nsoulless. He believed the man to be dead.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe situation was horrible, but not with out its fascination. The boy\\r\\nstopped to note it all. He was weak, faint and trembling; he could feel\\r\\nthe blood forsaking his face. Nevertheless, he set his teeth and\\r\\nresolutely advanced to the house. He had no conscious intention--it was\\r\\nthe mere courage of terror. He thrust his white face forward into the\\r\\nilluminated opening. At that instant a strange, harsh cry, a shriek,\\r\\nbroke upon the silence of the night--the note of a screech-owl. The man\\r\\nsprang to his feet, overturning the table and extinguishing the candle.\\r\\nThe boy took to his heels.\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE DAY BEFORE\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Good-morning, Colston. I am in luck, it seems. You have often said that\\r\\nmy commendation of your literary work was mere civility, and here you\\r\\nfind me absorbed--actually merged--in your latest story in the\\r\\n_Messenger_. Nothing less shocking than your touch upon my shoulder\\r\\nwould have roused me to consciousness.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The proof is stronger than you seem to know,\" replied the man\\r\\naddressed: \"so keen is your eagerness to read my story that you are\\r\\nwilling to renounce selfish considerations and forego all the pleasure\\r\\nthat you could get from it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I don\\'t understand you,\" said the other, folding the newspaper that he\\r\\nheld and putting it into his pocket. \"You writers are a queer lot,\\r\\nanyhow. Come, tell me what I have done or omitted in this matter. In\\r\\nwhat way does the pleasure that I get, or might get, from your work\\r\\ndepend on me?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"In many ways. Let me ask you how you would enjoy your breakfast if you\\r\\ntook it in this street car. Suppose the phonograph so perfected as to be\\r\\nable to give you an entire opera,--singing, orchestration, and all; do\\r\\nyou think you would get much pleasure out of it if you turned it on at\\r\\nyour office during business hours? Do you really care for a serenade by\\r\\nSchubert when you hear it fiddled by an untimely Italian on a morning\\r\\nferryboat? Are you always cocked and primed for enjoyment? Do you keep\\r\\nevery mood on tap, ready to any demand? Let me remind you, sir, that the\\r\\nstory which you have done me the honor to begin as a means of becoming\\r\\noblivious to the discomfort of this car is a ghost story!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well! Has the reader no duties corresponding to his privileges? You\\r\\nhave paid five cents for that newspaper. It is yours. You have the right\\r\\nto read it when and where you will. Much of what is in it is neither\\r\\nhelped nor harmed by time and place and mood; some of it actually\\r\\nrequires to be read at once--while it is fizzing. But my story is not of\\r\\nthat character. It is not \\'the very latest advices\\' from Ghostland. You\\r\\nare not expected to keep yourself _au courant_ with what is going on in\\r\\nthe realm of spooks. The stuff will keep until you have leisure to put\\r\\nyourself into the frame of mind appropriate to the sentiment of the\\r\\npiece--which I respectfully submit that you cannot do in a street car,\\r\\neven if you are the only passenger. The solitude is not of the right\\r\\nsort. An author has rights which the reader is bound to respect.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"For specific example?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The right to the reader\\'s undivided attention. To deny him this is\\r\\nimmoral. To make him share your attention with the rattle of a street\\r\\ncar, the moving panorama of the crowds on the sidewalks, and the\\r\\nbuildings beyond--with any of the thousands of distractions which make\\r\\nour customary environment--is to treat him with gross injustice. By God,\\r\\nit is infamous!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe speaker had risen to his feet and was steadying himself by one of\\r\\nthe straps hanging from the roof of the car. The other man looked up at\\r\\nhim in sudden astonishment, wondering how so trivial a grievance could\\r\\nseem to justify so strong language. He saw that his friend\\'s face was\\r\\nuncommonly pale and that his eyes glowed like living coals.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You know what I mean,\" continued the writer, impetuously crowding his\\r\\nwords--\"you know what I mean, Marsh. My stuff in this morning\\'s\\r\\n_Messenger_ is plainly sub-headed \\'A Ghost Story.\\' That is ample notice\\r\\nto all. Every honorable reader will understand it as prescribing by\\r\\nimplication the conditions under which the work is to be read.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe man addressed as Marsh winced a trifle, then asked with a smile:\\r\\n\"What conditions? You know that I am only a plain business man who\\r\\ncannot be supposed to understand such things. How, when, where should I\\r\\nread your ghost story?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"In solitude--at night--by the light of a candle. There are certain\\r\\nemotions which a writer can easily enough excite--such as compassion or\\r\\nmerriment. I can move you to tears or laughter under almost any\\r\\ncircumstances. But for my ghost story to be effective you must be made\\r\\nto feel fear--at least a strong sense of the supernatural--and that is a\\r\\ndifficult matter. I have a right to expect that if you read me at all\\r\\nyou will give me a chance; that you will make yourself accessible to the\\r\\nemotion that I try to inspire.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe car had now arrived at its terminus and stopped. The trip just\\r\\ncompleted was its first for the day and the conversation of the two\\r\\nearly passengers had not been interrupted. The streets were yet silent\\r\\nand desolate; the house tops were just touched by the rising sun. As\\r\\nthey stepped from the car and walked away together Marsh narrowly eyed\\r\\nhis companion, who was reported, like most men of uncommon literary\\r\\nability, to be addicted to various destructive vices. That is the\\r\\nrevenge which dull minds take upon bright ones in resentment of their\\r\\nsuperiority. Mr. Colston was known as a man of genius. There are honest\\r\\nsouls who believe that genius is a mode of excess. It was known that\\r\\nColston did not drink liquor, but many said that he ate opium. Something\\r\\nin his appearance that morning--a certain wildness of the eyes, an\\r\\nunusual pallor, a thickness and rapidity of speech--were taken by Mr.\\r\\nMarsh to confirm the report. Nevertheless, he had not the self-denial to\\r\\nabandon a subject which he found interesting, however it might excite\\r\\nhis friend.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Do you mean to say,\" he began, \"that if I take the trouble to observe\\r\\nyour directions--place myself in the conditions that you demand:\\r\\nsolitude, night and a tallow candle--you can with your ghostly work give\\r\\nme an uncomfortable sense of the supernatural, as you call it? Can you\\r\\naccelerate my pulse, make me start at sudden noises, send a nervous\\r\\nchill along my spine and cause my hair to rise?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nColston turned suddenly and looked him squarely in the eyes as they\\r\\nwalked. \"You would not dare--you have not the courage,\" he said. He\\r\\nemphasized the words with a contemptuous gesture. \"You are brave enough\\r\\nto read me in a street car, but--in a deserted house--alone--in the\\r\\nforest--at night! Bah! I have a manuscript in my pocket that would kill\\r\\nyou.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMarsh was angry. He knew himself courageous, and the words stung him.\\r\\n\"If you know such a place,\" he said, \"take me there to-night and leave\\r\\nme your story and a candle. Call for me when I\\'ve had time enough to\\r\\nread it and I\\'ll tell you the entire plot and--kick you out of the\\r\\nplace.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThat is how it occurred that the farmer\\'s boy, looking in at an unglazed\\r\\nwindow of the Breede house, saw a man sitting in the light of a candle.\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE DAY AFTER\\r\\n\\r\\nLate in the afternoon of the next day three men and a boy approached the\\r\\nBreede house from that point of the compass toward which the boy had\\r\\nfled the preceding night. The men were in high spirits; they talked very\\r\\nloudly and laughed. They made facetious and good-humored ironical\\r\\nremarks to the boy about his adventure, which evidently they did not\\r\\nbelieve in. The boy accepted their raillery with seriousness, making no\\r\\nreply. He had a sense of the fitness of things and knew that one who\\r\\nprofesses to have seen a dead man rise from his seat and blow out a\\r\\ncandle is not a credible witness.\\r\\n\\r\\nArriving at the house and finding the door unlocked, the party of\\r\\ninvestigators entered without ceremony. Leading out of the passage into\\r\\nwhich this door opened was another on the right and one on the left.\\r\\nThey entered the room on the left--the one which had the blank front\\r\\nwindow. Here was the dead body of a man.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt lay partly on one side, with the forearm beneath it, the cheek on the\\r\\nfloor. The eyes were wide open; the stare was not an agreeable thing to\\r\\nencounter. The lower jaw had fallen; a little pool of saliva had\\r\\ncollected beneath the mouth. An overthrown table, a partly burned\\r\\ncandle, a chair and some paper with writing on it were all else that the\\r\\nroom contained. The men looked at the body, touching the face in turn.\\r\\nThe boy gravely stood at the head, assuming a look of ownership. It was\\r\\nthe proudest moment of his life. One of the men said to him, \"You\\'re a\\r\\ngood \\'un\"--a remark which was received by the two others with nods of\\r\\nacquiescence. It was Scepticism apologizing to Truth. Then one of the\\r\\nmen took from the floor the sheet of manuscript and stepped to the\\r\\nwindow, for already the evening shadows were glooming the forest. The\\r\\nsong of the whip-poor-will was heard in the distance and a monstrous\\r\\nbeetle sped by the window on roaring wings and thundered away out of\\r\\nhearing. The man read:\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE MANUSCRIPT\\r\\n\\r\\n  \"Before committing the act which, rightly or wrongly, I have resolved\\r\\n  on and appearing before my Maker for judgment, I, James R. Colston,\\r\\n  deem it my duty as a journalist to make a statement to the public. My\\r\\n  name is, I believe, tolerably well known to the people as a writer of\\r\\n  tragic tales, but the somberest imagination never conceived anything\\r\\n  so tragic as my own life and history. Not in incident: my life has\\r\\n  been destitute of adventure and action. But my mental career has been\\r\\n  lurid with experiences such as kill and damn. I shall not recount them\\r\\n  here--some of them are written and ready for publication elsewhere.\\r\\n  The object of these lines is to explain to whomsoever may be\\r\\n  interested that my death is voluntary--my own act. I shall die at\\r\\n  twelve o\\'clock on the night of the 15th of July--a significant\\r\\n  anniversary to me, for it was on that day, and at that hour, that my\\r\\n  friend in time and eternity, Charles Breede, performed his vow to me\\r\\n  by the same act which his fidelity to our pledge now entails upon me.\\r\\n  He took his life in his little house in the Copeton woods. There was\\r\\n  the customary verdict of \\'temporary insanity.\\' Had I testified at that\\r\\n  inquest--had I told all I knew, they would have called _me_ mad!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHere followed an evidently long passage which the man reading read to\\r\\nhimself only. The rest he read aloud.\\r\\n\\r\\n  \"I have still a week of life in which to arrange my worldly affairs\\r\\n  and prepare for the great change. It is enough, for I have but few\\r\\n  affairs and it is now four years since death became an imperative\\r\\n  obligation.\\r\\n\\r\\n  \"I shall bear this writing on my body; the finder will please hand it\\r\\n  to the coroner.\\r\\n\\r\\n  \"JAMES R. COLSTON.\\r\\n\\r\\n  \"P.S.--Willard Marsh, on this the fatal fifteenth day of July I hand\\r\\n  you this manuscript, to be opened and read under the conditions agreed\\r\\n  upon, and at the place which I designated. I forego my intention to\\r\\n  keep it on my body to explain the manner of my death, which is not\\r\\n  important. It will serve to explain the manner of yours. I am to call\\r\\n  for you during the night to receive assurance that you have read the\\r\\n  manuscript. You know me well enough to expect me. But, my friend, it\\r\\n  _will be after twelve o\\'clock._ May God have mercy on our souls!\\r\\n\\r\\n  \"J.R.C.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore the man who was reading this manuscript had finished, the candle\\r\\nhad been picked up and lighted. When the reader had done, he quietly\\r\\nthrust the paper against the flame and despite the protestations of the\\r\\nothers held it until it was burnt to ashes. The man who did this, and\\r\\nwho afterward placidly endured a severe reprimand from the coroner, was\\r\\na son-in-law of the late Charles Breede. At the inquest nothing could\\r\\nelicit an intelligent account of what the paper had contained.\\r\\n\\r\\nFROM \"THE TIMES\"\\r\\n\\r\\n  \"Yesterday the Commissioners of Lunacy committed to the asylum Mr.\\r\\n  James R. Colston, a writer of some local reputation, connected with\\r\\n  the _Messenger_. It will be remembered that on the evening of the 15th\\r\\n  inst. Mr. Colston was given into custody by one of his fellow-lodgers\\r\\n  in the Baine House, who had observed him acting very suspiciously,\\r\\n  baring his throat and whetting a razor--occasionally trying its edge\\r\\n  by actually cutting through the skin of his arm, etc. On being handed\\r\\n  over to the police, the unfortunate man made a desperate resistance,\\r\\n  and has ever since been so violent that it has been necessary to keep\\r\\n  him in a strait-jacket. Most of our esteemed contemporary\\'s other\\r\\n  writers are still at large.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE BOARDED WINDOW\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1830, only a few miles away from what is now the great city of\\r\\nCincinnati, lay an immense and almost unbroken forest. The whole region\\r\\nwas sparsely settled by people of the frontier--restless souls who no\\r\\nsooner had hewn fairly habitable homes out of the wilderness and\\r\\nattained to that degree of prosperity which to-day we should call\\r\\nindigence than impelled by some mysterious impulse of their nature they\\r\\nabandoned all and pushed farther westward, to encounter new perils and\\r\\nprivations in the effort to regain the meagre comforts which they had\\r\\nvoluntarily renounced. Many of them had already forsaken that region for\\r\\nthe remoter settlements, but among those remaining was one who had been\\r\\nof those first arriving. He lived alone in a house of logs surrounded on\\r\\nall sides by the great forest, of whose gloom and silence he seemed a\\r\\npart, for no one had ever known him to smile nor speak a needless word.\\r\\nHis simple wants were supplied by the sale or barter of skins of wild\\r\\nanimals in the river town, for not a thing did he grow upon the land\\r\\nwhich, if needful, he might have claimed by right of undisturbed\\r\\npossession. There were evidences of \"improvement\"--a few acres of ground\\r\\nimmediately about the house had once been cleared of its trees, the\\r\\ndecayed stumps of which were half concealed by the new growth that had\\r\\nbeen suffered to repair the ravage wrought by the ax. Apparently the\\r\\nman\\'s zeal for agriculture had burned with a failing flame, expiring in\\r\\npenitential ashes.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe little log house, with its chimney of sticks, its roof of warping\\r\\nclapboards weighted with traversing poles and its \"chinking\" of clay,\\r\\nhad a single door and, directly opposite, a window. The latter, however,\\r\\nwas boarded up--nobody could remember a time when it was not. And none\\r\\nknew why it was so closed; certainly not because of the occupant\\'s\\r\\ndislike of light and air, for on those rare occasions when a hunter had\\r\\npassed that lonely spot the recluse had commonly been seen sunning\\r\\nhimself on his doorstep if heaven had provided sunshine for his need. I\\r\\nfancy there are few persons living to-day who ever knew the secret of\\r\\nthat window, but I am one, as you shall see.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe man\\'s name was said to be Murlock. He was apparently seventy years\\r\\nold, actually about fifty. Something besides years had had a hand in his\\r\\naging. His hair and long, full beard were white, his gray, lustreless\\r\\neyes sunken, his face singularly seamed with wrinkles which appeared to\\r\\nbelong to two intersecting systems. In figure he was tall and spare,\\r\\nwith a stoop of the shoulders--a burden bearer. I never saw him; these\\r\\nparticulars I learned from my grandfather, from whom also I got the\\r\\nman\\'s story when I was a lad. He had known him when living near by in\\r\\nthat early day.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne day Murlock was found in his cabin, dead. It was not a time and\\r\\nplace for coroners and newspapers, and I suppose it was agreed that he\\r\\nhad died from natural causes or I should have been told, and should\\r\\nremember. I know only that with what was probably a sense of the fitness\\r\\nof things the body was buried near the cabin, alongside the grave of his\\r\\nwife, who had preceded him by so many years that local tradition had\\r\\nretained hardly a hint of her existence. That closes the final chapter\\r\\nof this true story--excepting, indeed, the circumstance that many years\\r\\nafterward, in company with an equally intrepid spirit, I penetrated to\\r\\nthe place and ventured near enough to the ruined cabin to throw a stone\\r\\nagainst it, and ran away to avoid the ghost which every well-informed\\r\\nboy thereabout knew haunted the spot. But there is an earlier chapter--\\r\\nthat supplied by my grandfather.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Murlock built his cabin and began laying sturdily about with his ax\\r\\nto hew out a farm--the rifle, meanwhile, his means of support--he was\\r\\nyoung, strong and full of hope. In that eastern country whence he came\\r\\nhe had married, as was the fashion, a young woman in all ways worthy of\\r\\nhis honest devotion, who shared the dangers and privations of his lot\\r\\nwith a willing spirit and light heart. There is no known record of her\\r\\nname; of her charms of mind and person tradition is silent and the\\r\\ndoubter is at liberty to entertain his doubt; but God forbid that I\\r\\nshould share it! Of their affection and happiness there is abundant\\r\\nassurance in every added day of the man\\'s widowed life; for what but the\\r\\nmagnetism of a blessed memory could have chained that venturesome spirit\\r\\nto a lot like that?\\r\\n\\r\\nOne day Murlock returned from gunning in a distant part of the forest to\\r\\nfind his wife prostrate with fever, and delirious. There was no\\r\\nphysician within miles, no neighbor; nor was she in a condition to be\\r\\nleft, to summon help. So he set about the task of nursing her back to\\r\\nhealth, but at the end of the third day she fell into unconsciousness\\r\\nand so passed away, apparently, with never a gleam of returning reason.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom what we know of a nature like his we may venture to sketch in some\\r\\nof the details of the outline picture drawn by my grandfather. When\\r\\nconvinced that she was dead, Murlock had sense enough to remember that\\r\\nthe dead must be prepared for burial. In performance of this sacred duty\\r\\nhe blundered now and again, did certain things incorrectly, and others\\r\\nwhich he did correctly were done over and over. His occasional failures\\r\\nto accomplish some simple and ordinary act filled him with astonishment,\\r\\nlike that of a drunken man who wonders at the suspension of familiar\\r\\nnatural laws. He was surprised, too, that he did not weep--surprised and\\r\\na little ashamed; surely it is unkind not to weep for the dead.\\r\\n\"To-morrow,\" he said aloud, \"I shall have to make the coffin and dig the\\r\\ngrave; and then I shall miss her, when she is no longer in sight; but\\r\\nnow--she is dead, of course, but it is all right--it _must_ be all\\r\\nright, somehow. Things cannot be so bad as they seem.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe stood over the body in the fading light, adjusting the hair and\\r\\nputting the finishing touches to the simple toilet, doing all\\r\\nmechanically, with soulless care. And still through his consciousness\\r\\nran an undersense of conviction that all was right--that he should have\\r\\nher again as before, and everything explained. He had had no experience\\r\\nin grief; his capacity had not been enlarged by use. His heart could not\\r\\ncontain it all, nor his imagination rightly conceive it. He did not know\\r\\nhe was so hard struck; _that_ knowledge would come later, and never go.\\r\\nGrief is an artist of powers as various as the instruments upon which he\\r\\nplays his dirges for the dead, evoking from some the sharpest, shrillest\\r\\nnotes, from others the low, grave chords that throb recurrent like the\\r\\nslow beating of a distant drum. Some natures it startles; some it\\r\\nstupefies. To one it comes like the stroke of an arrow, stinging all the\\r\\nsensibilities to a keener life; to another as the blow of a bludgeon,\\r\\nwhich in crushing benumbs. We may conceive Murlock to have been that way\\r\\naffected, for (and here we are upon surer ground than that of\\r\\nconjecture) no sooner had he finished his pious work than, sinking into\\r\\na chair by the side of the table upon which the body lay, and noting how\\r\\nwhite the profile showed in the deepening gloom, he laid his arms upon\\r\\nthe table\\'s edge, and dropped his face into them, tearless yet and\\r\\nunutterably weary. At that moment came in through the open window a\\r\\nlong, wailing sound like the cry of a lost child in the far deeps of the\\r\\ndarkening wood! But the man did not move. Again, and nearer than before,\\r\\nsounded that unearthly cry upon his failing sense. Perhaps it was a wild\\r\\nbeast; perhaps it was a dream. For Murlock was asleep.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome hours later, as it afterward appeared, this unfaithful watcher\\r\\nawoke and lifting his head from his arms intently listened--he knew not\\r\\nwhy. There in the black darkness by the side of the dead, recalling all\\r\\nwithout a shock, he strained his eyes to see--he knew not what. His\\r\\nsenses were all alert, his breath was suspended, his blood had stilled\\r\\nits tides as if to assist the silence. Who--what had waked him, and\\r\\nwhere was it?\\r\\n\\r\\nSuddenly the table shook beneath his arms, and at the same moment he\\r\\nheard, or fancied that he heard, a light, soft step--another--sounds as\\r\\nof bare feet upon the floor!\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was terrified beyond the power to cry out or move. Perforce he\\r\\nwaited--waited there in the darkness through seeming centuries of such\\r\\ndread as one may know, yet live to tell. He tried vainly to speak the\\r\\ndead woman\\'s name, vainly to stretch forth his hand across the table to\\r\\nlearn if she were there. His throat was powerless, his arms and hands\\r\\nwere like lead. Then occurred something most frightful. Some heavy body\\r\\nseemed hurled against the table with an impetus that pushed it against\\r\\nhis breast so sharply as nearly to overthrow him, and at the same\\r\\ninstant he heard and felt the fall of something upon the floor with so\\r\\nviolent a thump that the whole house was shaken by the impact. A\\r\\nscuffling ensued, and a confusion of sounds impossible to describe.\\r\\nMurlock had risen to his feet. Fear had by excess forfeited control of\\r\\nhis faculties. He flung his hands upon the table. Nothing was there!\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is a point at which terror may turn to madness; and madness\\r\\nincites to action. With no definite intent, from no motive but the\\r\\nwayward impulse of a madman, Murlock sprang to the wall, with a little\\r\\ngroping seized his loaded rifle, and without aim discharged it. By the\\r\\nflash which lit up the room with a vivid illumination, he saw an\\r\\nenormous panther dragging the dead woman toward the window, its teeth\\r\\nfixed in her throat! Then there were darkness blacker than before, and\\r\\nsilence; and when he returned to consciousness the sun was high and the\\r\\nwood vocal with songs of birds.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe body lay near the window, where the beast had left it when\\r\\nfrightened away by the flash and report of the rifle. The clothing was\\r\\nderanged, the long hair in disorder, the limbs lay anyhow. From the\\r\\nthroat, dreadfully lacerated, had issued a pool of blood not yet\\r\\nentirely coagulated. The ribbon with which he had bound the wrists was\\r\\nbroken; the hands were tightly clenched. Between the teeth was a\\r\\nfragment of the animal\\'s ear.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA LADY FROM REDHORSE\\r\\n\\r\\nCORONADO, JUNE 20.\\r\\n\\r\\nI find myself more and more interested in him. It is not, I am sure,\\r\\nhis--do you know any good noun corresponding to the adjective\\r\\n\"handsome\"? One does not like to say \"beauty\" when speaking of a man. He\\r\\nis beautiful enough, Heaven knows; I should not even care to trust you\\r\\nwith him--faithfulest of all possible wives that you are--when he looks\\r\\nhis best, as he always does. Nor do I think the fascination of his\\r\\nmanner has much to do with it. You recollect that the charm of art\\r\\ninheres in that which is undefinable, and to you and me, my dear Irene,\\r\\nI fancy there is rather less of that in the branch of art under\\r\\nconsideration than to girls in their first season. I fancy I know how my\\r\\nfine gentleman produces many of his effects and could perhaps give him a\\r\\npointer on heightening them. Nevertheless, his manner is something truly\\r\\ndelightful. I suppose what interests me chiefly is the man\\'s brains. His\\r\\nconversation is the best I have ever heard and altogether unlike any one\\r\\nelse\\'s. He seems to know everything, as indeed he ought, for he has been\\r\\neverywhere, read everything, seen all there is to see--sometimes I think\\r\\nrather more than is good for him--and had acquaintance with the\\r\\n_queerest_ people. And then his voice--Irene, when I hear it I actually\\r\\nfeel as if I ought to have paid at the door, though of course it is my\\r\\nown door.\\r\\n\\r\\nJULY 3.\\r\\n\\r\\nI fear my remarks about Dr. Barritz must have been, being thoughtless,\\r\\nvery silly, or you would not have written of him with such levity, not\\r\\nto say disrespect. Believe me, dearest, he has more dignity and\\r\\nseriousness (of the kind, I mean, which is not inconsistent with a\\r\\nmanner sometimes playful and always charming) than any of the men that\\r\\nyou and I ever met. And young Raynor--you knew Raynor at Monterey--tells\\r\\nme that the men all like him and that he is treated with something like\\r\\ndeference everywhere. There is a mystery, too--something about his\\r\\nconnection with the Blavatsky people in Northern India. Raynor either\\r\\nwould not or could not tell me the particulars. I infer that Dr. Barritz\\r\\nis thought--don\\'t you dare to laugh!--a magician. Could anything be\\r\\nfiner than that?\\r\\n\\r\\nAn ordinary mystery is not, of course, so good as a scandal, but when it\\r\\nrelates to dark and dreadful practices--to the exercise of unearthly\\r\\npowers--could anything be more piquant? It explains, too, the singular\\r\\ninfluence the man has upon me. It is the undefinable in his art--black\\r\\nart. Seriously, dear, I quite tremble when he looks me full in the eyes\\r\\nwith those unfathomable orbs of his, which I have already vainly\\r\\nattempted to describe to you. How dreadful if he has the power to make\\r\\none fall in love! Do you know if the Blavatsky crowd have that power--\\r\\noutside of Sepoy?\\r\\n\\r\\nJULY 16.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe strangest thing! Last evening while Auntie was attending one of the\\r\\nhotel hops (I hate them) Dr. Barritz called. It was scandalously late--I\\r\\nactually believe that he had talked with Auntie in the ballroom and\\r\\nlearned from her that I was alone. I had been all the evening contriving\\r\\nhow to worm out of him the truth about his connection with the Thugs in\\r\\nSepoy, and all of that black business, but the moment he fixed his eyes\\r\\non me (for I admitted him, I\\'m ashamed to say) I was helpless. I\\r\\ntrembled, I blushed, I--O Irene, Irene, I love the man beyond expression\\r\\nand you know how it is yourself.\\r\\n\\r\\nFancy! I, an ugly duckling from Redhorse--daughter (they say) of old\\r\\nCalamity Jim--certainly his heiress, with no living relation but an\\r\\nabsurd old aunt who spoils me a thousand and fifty ways--absolutely\\r\\ndestitute of everything but a million dollars and a hope in Paris,--I\\r\\ndaring to love a god like him! My dear, if I had you here I could tear\\r\\nyour hair out with mortification.\\r\\n\\r\\nI am convinced that he is aware of my feeling, for he stayed but a few\\r\\nmoments, said nothing but what another man might have said half as well,\\r\\nand pretending that he had an engagement went away. I learned to-day (a\\r\\nlittle bird told me--the bell-bird) that he went straight to bed. How\\r\\ndoes that strike you as evidence of exemplary habits?\\r\\n\\r\\nJULY 17.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat little wretch, Raynor, called yesterday and his babble set me\\r\\nalmost wild. He never runs down--that is to say, when he exterminates a\\r\\nscore of reputations, more or less, he does not pause between one\\r\\nreputation and the next. (By the way, he inquired about you, and his\\r\\nmanifestations of interest in you had, I confess, a good deal of\\r\\n_vraisemblance._.) Mr. Raynor observes no game laws; like Death (which\\r\\nhe would inflict if slander were fatal) he has all seasons for his own.\\r\\nBut I like him, for we knew each other at Redhorse when we were young.\\r\\nHe was known in those days as \"Giggles,\" and I--O Irene, can you ever\\r\\nforgive me?--I was called \"Gunny.\" God knows why; perhaps in allusion to\\r\\nthe material of my pinafores; perhaps because the name is in\\r\\nalliteration with \"Giggles,\" for Gig and I were inseparable playmates,\\r\\nand the miners may have thought it a delicate civility to recognize some\\r\\nkind of relationship between us.\\r\\n\\r\\nLater, we took in a third--another of Adversity\\'s brood, who, like\\r\\nGarrick between Tragedy and Comedy, had a chronic inability to\\r\\nadjudicate the rival claims of Frost and Famine. Between him and misery\\r\\nthere was seldom anything more than a single suspender and the hope of a\\r\\nmeal which would at the same time support life and make it\\r\\ninsupportable. He literally picked up a precarious living for himself\\r\\nand an aged mother by \"chloriding the dumps,\" that is to say, the miners\\r\\npermitted him to search the heaps of waste rock for such pieces of \"pay\\r\\nore\" as had been overlooked; and these he sacked up and sold at the\\r\\nSyndicate Mill. He became a member of our firm--\"Gunny, Giggles, and\\r\\nDumps\" thenceforth--through my favor; for I could not then, nor can I\\r\\nnow, be indifferent to his courage and prowess in defending against\\r\\nGiggles the immemorial right of his sex to insult a strange and\\r\\nunprotected female--myself. After old Jim struck it in the Calamity and\\r\\nI began to wear shoes and go to school, and in emulation Giggles took to\\r\\nwashing his face and became Jack Raynor, of Wells, Fargo & Co., and old\\r\\nMrs. Barts was herself chlorided to her fathers, Dumps drifted over to\\r\\nSan Juan Smith and turned stage driver, and was killed by road agents,\\r\\nand so forth.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhy do I tell you all this, dear? Because it is heavy on my heart.\\r\\nBecause I walk the Valley of Humility. Because I am subduing myself to\\r\\npermanent consciousness of my unworthiness to unloose the latchet of Dr.\\r\\nBarritz\\'s shoe. Because, oh dear, oh dear, there\\'s a cousin of Dumps at\\r\\nthis hotel! I haven\\'t spoken to him. I never had much acquaintance with\\r\\nhim,--but do you suppose he has recognized me? Do, please give me in\\r\\nyour next your candid, sure-enough opinion about it, and say you don\\'t\\r\\nthink so. Do you suppose He knows about me already, and that that is why\\r\\nHe left me last evening when He saw that I blushed and trembled like a\\r\\nfool under His eyes? You know I can\\'t bribe _all_ the newspapers, and I\\r\\ncan\\'t go back on anybody who was civil to Gunny at Redhorse--not if I\\'m\\r\\npitched out of society into the sea. So the skeleton sometimes rattles\\r\\nbehind the door. I never cared much before, as you know, but now--_now_\\r\\nit is not the same. Jack Raynor I am sure of--he will not tell Him. He\\r\\nseems, indeed, to hold Him in such respect as hardly to dare speak to\\r\\nHim at all, and I\\'m a good deal that way myself. Dear, dear! I wish I\\r\\nhad something besides a million dollars! If Jack were three inches\\r\\ntaller I\\'d marry him alive and go back to Redhorse and wear sackcloth\\r\\nagain to the end of my miserable days.\\r\\n\\r\\nJULY 25.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe had a perfectly splendid sunset last evening and I must tell you all\\r\\nabout it. I ran away from Auntie and everybody and was walking alone on\\r\\nthe beach. I expect you to believe, you infidel! that I had not looked\\r\\nout of my window on the seaward side of the hotel and seen Him walking\\r\\nalone on the beach. If you are not lost to every feeling of womanly\\r\\ndelicacy you will accept my statement without question. I soon\\r\\nestablished myself under my sunshade and had for some time been gazing\\r\\nout dreamily over the sea, when he approached, walking close to the edge\\r\\nof the water--it was ebb tide. I assure you the wet sand actually\\r\\nbrightened about his feet! As he approached me he lifted his hat,\\r\\nsaying, \"Miss Dement, may I sit with you?--or will you walk with me?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe possibility that neither might be agreeable seems not to have\\r\\noccurred to him. Did you ever know such assurance? Assurance? My dear,\\r\\nit was gall, downright _gall!_ Well, I didn\\'t find it wormwood, and\\r\\nreplied, with my untutored Redhorse heart in my throat, \"I--I shall be\\r\\npleased to do _anything_.\" Could words have been more stupid? There are\\r\\ndepths of fatuity in me, friend o\\' my soul, that are simply bottomless!\\r\\n\\r\\nHe extended his hand, smiling, and I delivered mine into it without a\\r\\nmoment\\'s hesitation, and when his fingers closed about it to assist me\\r\\nto my feet the consciousness that it trembled made me blush worse than\\r\\nthe red west. I got up, however, and after a while, observing that he\\r\\nhad not let go my hand I pulled on it a little, but unsuccessfully. He\\r\\nsimply held on, saying nothing, but looking down into my face with some\\r\\nkind of smile--I didn\\'t know--how could I?--whether it was affectionate,\\r\\nderisive, or what, for I did not look at him. How beautiful he was!--\\r\\nwith the red fires of the sunset burning in the depths of his eyes. Do\\r\\nyou know, dear, if the Thugs and Experts of the Blavatsky region have\\r\\nany special kind of eyes? Ah, you should have seen his superb attitude,\\r\\nthe god-like inclination of his head as he stood over me after I had got\\r\\nupon my feet! It was a noble picture, but I soon destroyed it, for I\\r\\nbegan at once to sink again to the earth. There was only one thing for\\r\\nhim to do, and he did it; he supported me with an arm about my waist.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Miss Dement, are you ill?\" he said.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was not an exclamation; there was neither alarm nor solicitude in it.\\r\\nIf he had added: \"I suppose that is about what I am expected to say,\" he\\r\\nwould hardly have expressed his sense of the situation more clearly. His\\r\\nmanner filled me with shame and indignation, for I was suffering\\r\\nacutely. I wrenched my hand out of his, grasped the arm supporting me\\r\\nand pushing myself free, fell plump into the sand and sat helpless. My\\r\\nhat had fallen off in the struggle and my hair tumbled about my face and\\r\\nshoulders in the most mortifying way.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Go away from me,\" I cried, half choking. \"O _please_ go away, you--you\\r\\nThug! How dare you think _that_ when my leg is asleep?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI actually said those identical words! And then I broke down and sobbed.\\r\\nIrene, I _blubbered_!\\r\\n\\r\\nHis manner altered in an instant--I could see that much through my\\r\\nfingers and hair. He dropped on one knee beside me, parted the tangle of\\r\\nhair and said in the tenderest way: \"My poor girl, God knows I have not\\r\\nintended to pain you. How should I?--I who love you--I who have loved\\r\\nyou for--for years and years!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe had pulled my wet hands away from my face and was covering them with\\r\\nkisses. My cheeks were like two coals, my whole face was flaming and, I\\r\\nthink, steaming. What could I do? I hid it on his shoulder--there was no\\r\\nother place. And, O my dear friend, how my leg tingled and thrilled, and\\r\\nhow I wanted to kick!\\r\\n\\r\\nWe sat so for a long time. He had released one of my hands to pass his\\r\\narm about me again and I possessed myself of my handkerchief and was\\r\\ndrying my eyes and my nose. I would not look up until that was done; he\\r\\ntried in vain to push me a little away and gaze into my face. Presently,\\r\\nwhen all was right, and it had grown a bit dark, I lifted my head,\\r\\nlooked him straight in the eyes and smiled my best--my level best, dear.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What do you mean,\" I said, \"by \\'years and years\\'?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Dearest,\" he replied, very gravely, very earnestly, \"in the absence of\\r\\nthe sunken cheeks, the hollow eyes, the lank hair, the slouching gait,\\r\\nthe rags, dirt, and youth, can you not--will you not understand? Gunny,\\r\\nI\\'m Dumps!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIn a moment I was upon my feet and he upon his. I seized him by the\\r\\nlapels of his coat and peered into his handsome face in the deepening\\r\\ndarkness. I was breathless with excitement.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And you are not dead?\" I asked, hardly knowing what I said.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Only dead in love, dear. I recovered from the road agent\\'s bullet, but\\r\\nthis, I fear, is fatal.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But about Jack--Mr. Raynor? Don\\'t you know--\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am ashamed to say, darling, that it was through that unworthy\\r\\nperson\\'s suggestion that I came here from Vienna.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIrene, they have roped in your affectionate friend,\\r\\n\\r\\n                   MARY JANE DEMENT.\\r\\n\\r\\nP.S.--The worst of it is that there is no mystery; that was the\\r\\ninvention of Jack Raynor, to arouse my curiosity. James is not a Thug.\\r\\nHe solemnly assures me that in all his wanderings he has never set foot\\r\\nin Sepoy.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE EYES OF THE PANTHER\\r\\n\\r\\nI\\r\\n\\r\\nONE DOES NOT ALWAYS MARRY WHEN INSANE\\r\\n\\r\\nA man and a woman--nature had done the grouping--sat on a rustic seat,\\r\\nin the late afternoon. The man was middle-aged, slender, swarthy, with\\r\\nthe expression of a poet and the complexion of a pirate--a man at whom\\r\\none would look again. The woman was young, blonde, graceful, with\\r\\nsomething in her figure and movements suggesting the word \"lithe.\" She\\r\\nwas habited in a gray gown with odd brown markings in the texture. She\\r\\nmay have been beautiful; one could not readily say, for her eyes denied\\r\\nattention to all else. They were gray-green, long and narrow, with an\\r\\nexpression defying analysis. One could only know that they were\\r\\ndisquieting. Cleopatra may have had such eyes.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe man and the woman talked.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes,\" said the woman, \"I love you, God knows! But marry you, no. I\\r\\ncannot, will not.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Irene, you have said that many times, yet always have denied me a\\r\\nreason. I\\'ve a right to know, to understand, to feel and prove my\\r\\nfortitude if I have it. Give me a reason.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"For loving you?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe woman was smiling through her tears and her pallor. That did not\\r\\nstir any sense of humor in the man.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No; there is no reason for that. A reason for not marrying me. I\\'ve a\\r\\nright to know. I must know. I will know!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe had risen and was standing before her with clenched hands, on his\\r\\nface a frown--it might have been called a scowl. He looked as if he\\r\\nmight attempt to learn by strangling her. She smiled no more--merely sat\\r\\nlooking up into his face with a fixed, set regard that was utterly\\r\\nwithout emotion or sentiment. Yet it had something in it that tamed his\\r\\nresentment and made him shiver.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You are determined to have my reason?\" she asked in a tone that was\\r\\nentirely mechanical--a tone that might have been her look made audible.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If you please--if I\\'m not asking too much.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nApparently this lord of creation was yielding some part of his dominion\\r\\nover his co-creature.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Very well, you shall know: I am insane.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe man started, then looked incredulous and was conscious that he ought\\r\\nto be amused. But, again, the sense of humor failed him in his need and\\r\\ndespite his disbelief he was profoundly disturbed by that which he did\\r\\nnot believe. Between our convictions and our feelings there is no good\\r\\nunderstanding.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That is what the physicians would say,\" the woman continued--\"if they\\r\\nknew. I might myself prefer to call it a case of \\'possession.\\' Sit down\\r\\nand hear what I have to say.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe man silently resumed his seat beside her on the rustic bench by the\\r\\nwayside. Over-against them on the eastern side of the valley the hills\\r\\nwere already sunset-flushed and the stillness all about was of that\\r\\npeculiar quality that foretells the twilight. Something of its\\r\\nmysterious and significant solemnity had imparted itself to the man\\'s\\r\\nmood. In the spiritual, as in the material world, are signs and presages\\r\\nof night. Rarely meeting her look, and whenever he did so conscious of\\r\\nthe indefinable dread with which, despite their feline beauty, her eyes\\r\\nalways affected him, Jenner Brading listened in silence to the story\\r\\ntold by Irene Marlowe. In deference to the reader\\'s possible prejudice\\r\\nagainst the artless method of an unpractised historian the author\\r\\nventures to substitute his own version for hers.\\r\\n\\r\\nII\\r\\n\\r\\nA ROOM MAY BE TOO NARROW FOR THREE, THOUGH ONE IS OUTSIDE\\r\\n\\r\\nIn a little log house containing a single room sparely and rudely\\r\\nfurnished, crouching on the floor against one of the walls, was a woman,\\r\\nclasping to her breast a child. Outside, a dense unbroken forest\\r\\nextended for many miles in every direction. This was at night and the\\r\\nroom was black dark: no human eye could have discerned the woman and the\\r\\nchild. Yet they were observed, narrowly, vigilantly, with never even a\\r\\nmomentary slackening of attention; and that is the pivotal fact upon\\r\\nwhich this narrative turns.\\r\\n\\r\\nCharles Marlowe was of the class, now extinct in this country, of\\r\\nwoodmen pioneers--men who found their most acceptable surroundings in\\r\\nsylvan solitudes that stretched along the eastern slope of the\\r\\nMississippi Valley, from the Great Lakes to the Gulf of Mexico. For more\\r\\nthan a hundred years these men pushed ever westward, generation after\\r\\ngeneration, with rifle and ax, reclaiming from Nature and her savage\\r\\nchildren here and there an isolated acreage for the plow, no sooner\\r\\nreclaimed than surrendered to their less venturesome but more thrifty\\r\\nsuccessors. At last they burst through the edge of the forest into the\\r\\nopen country and vanished as if they had fallen over a cliff. The\\r\\nwoodman pioneer is no more; the pioneer of the plains--he whose easy\\r\\ntask it was to subdue for occupancy two-thirds of the country in a\\r\\nsingle generation--is another and inferior creation. With Charles\\r\\nMarlowe in the wilderness, sharing the dangers, hardships and privations\\r\\nof that strange, unprofitable life, were his wife and child, to whom, in\\r\\nthe manner of his class, in which the domestic virtues were a religion,\\r\\nhe was passionately attached. The woman was still young enough to be\\r\\ncomely, new enough to the awful isolation of her lot to be cheerful. By\\r\\nwithholding the large capacity for happiness which the simple\\r\\nsatisfactions of the forest life could not have filled, Heaven had dealt\\r\\nhonorably with her. In her light household tasks, her child, her husband\\r\\nand her few foolish books, she found abundant provision for her needs.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne morning in midsummer Marlowe took down his rifle from the wooden\\r\\nhooks on the wall and signified his intention of getting game.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We\\'ve meat enough,\" said the wife; \"please don\\'t go out to-day. I\\r\\ndreamed last night, O, such a dreadful thing! I cannot recollect it, but\\r\\nI\\'m almost sure that it will come to pass if you go out.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is painful to confess that Marlowe received this solemn statement\\r\\nwith less of gravity than was due to the mysterious nature of the\\r\\ncalamity foreshadowed. In truth, he laughed.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Try to remember,\" he said. \"Maybe you dreamed that Baby had lost the\\r\\npower of speech.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe conjecture was obviously suggested by the fact that Baby, clinging\\r\\nto the fringe of his hunting-coat with all her ten pudgy thumbs was at\\r\\nthat moment uttering her sense of the situation in a series of exultant\\r\\ngoo-goos inspired by sight of her father\\'s raccoon-skin cap.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe woman yielded: lacking the gift of humor she could not hold out\\r\\nagainst his kindly badinage. So, with a kiss for the mother and a kiss\\r\\nfor the child, he left the house and closed the door upon his happiness\\r\\nforever.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt nightfall he had not returned. The woman prepared supper and waited.\\r\\nThen she put Baby to bed and sang softly to her until she slept. By this\\r\\ntime the fire on the hearth, at which she had cooked supper, had burned\\r\\nout and the room was lighted by a single candle. This she afterward\\r\\nplaced in the open window as a sign and welcome to the hunter if he\\r\\nshould approach from that side. She had thoughtfully closed and barred\\r\\nthe door against such wild animals as might prefer it to an open window\\r\\n--of the habits of beasts of prey in entering a house uninvited she was\\r\\nnot advised, though with true female prevision she may have considered\\r\\nthe possibility of their entrance by way of the chimney. As the night\\r\\nwore on she became not less anxious, but more drowsy, and at last rested\\r\\nher arms upon the bed by the child and her head upon the arms. The\\r\\ncandle in the window burned down to the socket, sputtered and flared a\\r\\nmoment and went out unobserved; for the woman slept and dreamed.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn her dreams she sat beside the cradle of a second child. The first one\\r\\nwas dead. The father was dead. The home in the forest was lost and the\\r\\ndwelling in which she lived was unfamiliar. There were heavy oaken\\r\\ndoors, always closed, and outside the windows, fastened into the thick\\r\\nstone walls, were iron bars, obviously (so she thought) a provision\\r\\nagainst Indians. All this she noted with an infinite self-pity, but\\r\\nwithout surprise--an emotion unknown in dreams. The child in the cradle\\r\\nwas invisible under its coverlet which something impelled her to remove.\\r\\nShe did so, disclosing the face of a wild animal! In the shock of this\\r\\ndreadful revelation the dreamer awoke, trembling in the darkness of her\\r\\ncabin in the wood.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs a sense of her actual surroundings came slowly back to her she felt\\r\\nfor the child that was not a dream, and assured herself by its breathing\\r\\nthat all was well with it; nor could she forbear to pass a hand lightly\\r\\nacross its face. Then, moved by some impulse for which she probably\\r\\ncould not have accounted, she rose and took the sleeping babe in her\\r\\narms, holding it close against her breast. The head of the child\\'s cot\\r\\nwas against the wall to which the woman now turned her back as she\\r\\nstood. Lifting her eyes she saw two bright objects starring the darkness\\r\\nwith a reddish-green glow. She took them to be two coals on the hearth,\\r\\nbut with her returning sense of direction came the disquieting\\r\\nconsciousness that they were not in that quarter of the room, moreover\\r\\nwere too high, being nearly at the level of the eyes--of her own eyes.\\r\\nFor these were the eyes of a panther.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe beast was at the open window directly opposite and not five paces\\r\\naway. Nothing but those terrible eyes was visible, but in the dreadful\\r\\ntumult of her feelings as the situation disclosed itself to her\\r\\nunderstanding she somehow knew that the animal was standing on its\\r\\nhinder feet, supporting itself with its paws on the window-ledge. That\\r\\nsignified a malign interest--not the mere gratification of an indolent\\r\\ncuriosity. The consciousness of the attitude was an added horror,\\r\\naccentuating the menace of those awful eyes, in whose steadfast fire her\\r\\nstrength and courage were alike consumed. Under their silent questioning\\r\\nshe shuddered and turned sick. Her knees failed her, and by degrees,\\r\\ninstinctively striving to avoid a sudden movement that might bring the\\r\\nbeast upon her, she sank to the floor, crouched against the wall and\\r\\ntried to shield the babe with her trembling body without withdrawing her\\r\\ngaze from the luminous orbs that were killing her. No thought of her\\r\\nhusband came to her in her agony--no hope nor suggestion of rescue or\\r\\nescape. Her capacity for thought and feeling had narrowed to the\\r\\ndimensions of a single emotion--fear of the animal\\'s spring, of the\\r\\nimpact of its body, the buffeting of its great arms, the feel of its\\r\\nteeth in her throat, the mangling of her babe. Motionless now and in\\r\\nabsolute silence, she awaited her doom, the moments growing to hours, to\\r\\nyears, to ages; and still those devilish eyes maintained their watch.\\r\\n\\r\\nReturning to his cabin late at night with a deer on his shoulders\\r\\nCharles Marlowe tried the door. It did not yield. He knocked; there was\\r\\nno answer. He laid down his deer and went round to the window. As he\\r\\nturned the angle of the building he fancied he heard a sound as of\\r\\nstealthy footfalls and a rustling in the undergrowth of the forest, but\\r\\nthey were too slight for certainty, even to his practised ear.\\r\\nApproaching the window, and to his surprise finding it open, he threw\\r\\nhis leg over the sill and entered. All was darkness and silence. He\\r\\ngroped his way to the fire-place, struck a match and lit a candle.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen he looked about. Cowering on the floor against a wall was his wife,\\r\\nclasping his child. As he sprang toward her she rose and broke into\\r\\nlaughter, long, loud, and mechanical, devoid of gladness and devoid of\\r\\nsense--the laughter that is not out of keeping with the clanking of a\\r\\nchain. Hardly knowing what he did he extended his arms. She laid the\\r\\nbabe in them. It was dead--pressed to death in its mother\\'s embrace.\\r\\n\\r\\nIII\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE THEORY OF THE DEFENSE\\r\\n\\r\\nThat is what occurred during a night in a forest, but not all of it did\\r\\nIrene Marlowe relate to Jenner Brading; not all of it was known to her.\\r\\nWhen she had concluded the sun was below the horizon and the long summer\\r\\ntwilight had begun to deepen in the hollows of the land. For some\\r\\nmoments Brading was silent, expecting the narrative to be carried\\r\\nforward to some definite connection with the conversation introducing\\r\\nit; but the narrator was as silent as he, her face averted, her hands\\r\\nclasping and unclasping themselves as they lay in her lap, with a\\r\\nsingular suggestion of an activity independent of her will.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is a sad, a terrible story,\" said Brading at last, \"but I do not\\r\\nunderstand. You call Charles Marlowe father; that I know. That he is old\\r\\nbefore his time, broken by some great sorrow, I have seen, or thought I\\r\\nsaw. But, pardon me, you said that you--that you--\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That I am insane,\" said the girl, without a movement of head or body.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But, Irene, you say--please, dear, do not look away from me--you say\\r\\nthat the child was dead, not demented.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, that one--I am the second. I was born three months after that\\r\\nnight, my mother being mercifully permitted to lay down her life in\\r\\ngiving me mine.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBrading was again silent; he was a trifle dazed and could not at once\\r\\nthink of the right thing to say. Her face was still turned away. In his\\r\\nembarrassment he reached impulsively toward the hands that lay closing\\r\\nand unclosing in her lap, but something--he could not have said what--\\r\\nrestrained him. He then remembered, vaguely, that he had never\\r\\naltogether cared to take her hand.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Is it likely,\" she resumed, \"that a person born under such\\r\\ncircumstances is like others--is what you call sane?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBrading did not reply; he was preoccupied with a new thought that was\\r\\ntaking shape in his mind--what a scientist would have called an\\r\\nhypothesis; a detective, a theory. It might throw an added light, albeit\\r\\na lurid one, upon such doubt of her sanity as her own assertion had not\\r\\ndispelled.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe country was still new and, outside the villages, sparsely populated.\\r\\nThe professional hunter was still a familiar figure, and among his\\r\\ntrophies were heads and pelts of the larger kinds of game. Tales\\r\\nvariously credible of nocturnal meetings with savage animals in lonely\\r\\nroads were sometimes current, passed through the customary stages of\\r\\ngrowth and decay, and were forgotten. A recent addition to these popular\\r\\napocrypha, originating, apparently, by spontaneous generation in several\\r\\nhouseholds, was of a panther which had frightened some of their members\\r\\nby looking in at windows by night. The yarn had caused its little ripple\\r\\nof excitement--had even attained to the distinction of a place in the\\r\\nlocal newspaper; but Brading had given it no attention. Its likeness to\\r\\nthe story to which he had just listened now impressed him as perhaps\\r\\nmore than accidental. Was it not possible that the one story had\\r\\nsuggested the other--that finding congenial conditions in a morbid mind\\r\\nand a fertile fancy, it had grown to the tragic tale that he had heard?\\r\\n\\r\\nBrading recalled certain circumstances of the girl\\'s history and\\r\\ndisposition, of which, with love\\'s incuriosity, he had hitherto been\\r\\nheedless--such as her solitary life with her father, at whose house no\\r\\none, apparently, was an acceptable visitor and her strange fear of the\\r\\nnight, by which those who knew her best accounted for her never being\\r\\nseen after dark. Surely in such a mind imagination once kindled might\\r\\nburn with a lawless flame, penetrating and enveloping the entire\\r\\nstructure. That she was mad, though the conviction gave him the acutest\\r\\npain, he could no longer doubt; she had only mistaken an effect of her\\r\\nmental disorder for its cause, bringing into imaginary relation with her\\r\\nown personality the vagaries of the local myth-makers. With some vague\\r\\nintention of testing his new \"theory,\" and no very definite notion of\\r\\nhow to set about it he said, gravely, but with hesitation:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Irene, dear, tell me--I beg you will not take offence, but tell me--\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have told you,\" she interrupted, speaking with a passionate\\r\\nearnestness that he had not known her to show--\"I have already told you\\r\\nthat we cannot marry; is anything else worth saying?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore he could stop her she had sprung from her seat and without\\r\\nanother word or look was gliding away among the trees toward her\\r\\nfather\\'s house. Brading had risen to detain her; he stood watching her\\r\\nin silence until she had vanished in the gloom. Suddenly he started as\\r\\nif he had been shot; his face took on an expression of amazement and\\r\\nalarm: in one of the black shadows into which she had disappeared he had\\r\\ncaught a quick, brief glimpse of shining eyes! For an instant he was\\r\\ndazed and irresolute; then he dashed into the wood after her, shouting:\\r\\n\"Irene, Irene, look out! The panther! The panther!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIn a moment he had passed through the fringe of forest into open ground\\r\\nand saw the girl\\'s gray skirt vanishing into her father\\'s door. No\\r\\npanther was visible.\\r\\n\\r\\nIV\\r\\n\\r\\nAN APPEAL TO THE CONSCIENCE OF GOD\\r\\n\\r\\nJenner Brading, attorney-at-law, lived in a cottage at the edge of the\\r\\ntown. Directly behind the dwelling was the forest. Being a bachelor, and\\r\\ntherefore, by the Draconian moral code of the time and place denied the\\r\\nservices of the only species of domestic servant known thereabout, the\\r\\n\"hired girl,\" he boarded at the village hotel, where also was his\\r\\noffice. The woodside cottage was merely a lodging maintained--at no\\r\\ngreat cost, to be sure--as an evidence of prosperity and respectability.\\r\\nIt would hardly do for one to whom the local newspaper had pointed with\\r\\npride as \"the foremost jurist of his time\" to be \"homeless,\" albeit he\\r\\nmay sometimes have suspected that the words \"home\" and \"house\" were not\\r\\nstrictly synonymous. Indeed, his consciousness of the disparity and his\\r\\nwill to harmonize it were matters of logical inference, for it was\\r\\ngenerally reported that soon after the cottage was built its owner had\\r\\nmade a futile venture in the direction of marriage--had, in truth, gone\\r\\nso far as to be rejected by the beautiful but eccentric daughter of Old\\r\\nMan Marlowe, the recluse. This was publicly believed because he had told\\r\\nit himself and she had not--a reversal of the usual order of things\\r\\nwhich could hardly fail to carry conviction.\\r\\n\\r\\nBrading\\'s bedroom was at the rear of the house, with a single window\\r\\nfacing the forest.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne night he was awakened by a noise at that window; he could hardly\\r\\nhave said what it was like. With a little thrill of the nerves he sat up\\r\\nin bed and laid hold of the revolver which, with a forethought most\\r\\ncommendable in one addicted to the habit of sleeping on the ground floor\\r\\nwith an open window, he had put under his pillow. The room was in\\r\\nabsolute darkness, but being unterrified he knew where to direct his\\r\\neyes, and there he held them, awaiting in silence what further might\\r\\noccur. He could now dimly discern the aperture--a square of lighter\\r\\nblack. Presently there appeared at its lower edge two gleaming eyes that\\r\\nburned with a malignant lustre inexpressibly terrible! Brading\\'s heart\\r\\ngave a great jump, then seemed to stand still. A chill passed along his\\r\\nspine and through his hair; he felt the blood forsake his cheeks. He\\r\\ncould not have cried out--not to save his life; but being a man of\\r\\ncourage he would not, to save his life, have done so if he had been\\r\\nable. Some trepidation his coward body might feel, but his spirit was of\\r\\nsterner stuff. Slowly the shining eyes rose with a steady motion that\\r\\nseemed an approach, and slowly rose Brading\\'s right hand, holding the\\r\\npistol. He fired!\\r\\n\\r\\nBlinded by the flash and stunned by the report, Brading nevertheless\\r\\nheard, or fancied that he heard, the wild, high scream of the panther,\\r\\nso human in sound, so devilish in suggestion. Leaping from the bed he\\r\\nhastily clothed himself and, pistol in hand, sprang from the door,\\r\\nmeeting two or three men who came running up from the road. A brief\\r\\nexplanation was followed by a cautious search of the house. The grass\\r\\nwas wet with dew; beneath the window it had been trodden and partly\\r\\nleveled for a wide space, from which a devious trail, visible in the\\r\\nlight of a lantern, led away into the bushes. One of the men stumbled\\r\\nand fell upon his hands, which as he rose and rubbed them together were\\r\\nslippery. On examination they were seen to be red with blood.\\r\\n\\r\\nAn encounter, unarmed, with a wounded panther was not agreeable to their\\r\\ntaste; all but Brading turned back. He, with lantern and pistol, pushed\\r\\ncourageously forward into the wood. Passing through a difficult\\r\\nundergrowth he came into a small opening, and there his courage had its\\r\\nreward, for there he found the body of his victim. But it was no\\r\\npanther. What it was is told, even to this day, upon a weather-worn\\r\\nheadstone in the village churchyard, and for many years was attested\\r\\ndaily at the graveside by the bent figure and sorrow-seamed face of Old\\r\\nMan Marlowe, to whose soul, and to the soul of his strange, unhappy\\r\\nchild, peace. Peace and reparation.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n'\n"

npoliticia he wa naturally a original secessionist and ardently ndevoted to the southe cause circumstance of a imperious nature nwhich it is unnecessary to relate here had prevented him from taking nservice with the gallant army that had fought the disastrous campaign nending with the fall of corinth and he chafed unde the inglorious nrestraint longing fo the release of his energy the large life of nthe soldie the opportunity fo distinctio that opportunity he felt nwould come a it come to all i wa time meanwhile he did what he ncould no service wa too humble fo him to perform i aid of the

the owl creek bridge farquha asked about thirty mile is there no force o this side the creek only picket post half mile out o the railroad and single nsentinel at this end of the bridge suppose ma civilia and student of hanging should elude the npicket post and perhaps get the bette of the sentinel said farquha nsmiling what could he accomplish nthe soldie reflected wa there month ago he replied nobserved that the flood of last winte had lodged great quantity of ndriftwood against the woode pie at this end of the bridge it is now ndry and would bu like tow nthe lady had now brought

the pai of sharp pressure nupo his throat followed by sense of suffocatio kee poignant nagonies seemed to shoot from his neck downward through every fibre of nhis body and limb these pain appeared to flash along well defined nlines of ramificatio and to beat with a inconceivably rapid nperiodicity they seemed like stream of pulsating fire heating him to na intolerable temperature a to his head he wa conscious of nothing nbut feeling of fulness of congestio these sensation were nunaccompanied by thought the intellectual part of his nature wa nalready effaced he had powe only to feel and feeling wa torment he nwas conscious of motio encompassed i luminous cloud of which he nwas now merely the fiery heart without material substance he swung nthrough unthinkable arc of oscillatio like vast pendulum the all nat once with terrible suddenness the light about him shot upward with nthe noise of loud plash frightful roaring wa i his ear and all nwas cold and dark the powe of thought wa restored he knew that the nrope had broke and he had falle into the stream there wa no nadditional strangulatio the noose about his neck wa already nsuffocating him and kept the wate from his lung to die of hanging at nthe bottom of rive the idea seemed to him ludicrous he opened his neyes i the darkness and saw above him gleam of light but how ndistant how inaccessible he wa still sinking fo the light became nfainte and fainte until it wa mere glimme the it bega to grow nand brighte and he knew that he wa rising toward the surface knew it nwith reluctance fo he wa now very comfortable to be hanged and ndrowned he thought that is not so bad but do not wish to be shot nno will not be shot that is not fai nhe wa not conscious of a effort but sharp pai i his wrist napprised him that he wa

fo the undoing of the noose had bee succeeded by nthe direst pang that he had yet experienced his neck ached horribly nhis brai wa o fire his heart which had bee fluttering faintly ngave great leap trying to force itself out at his mouth his whole nbody wa racked and wrenched with a insupportable anguish but his ndisobedient hand gave no heed to the command they beat the wate nvigorously with quick downward stroke forcing him to the surface he nfelt his head emerge his eye were blinded by the sunlight his chest nexpanded convulsively and with supreme and crowning agony his lung nengulfed great draught of ai which instantly he expelled i nshriek nhe wa now i full possessio of his physical sens they were indeed npreternaturally kee and alert something i the awful disturbance of nhis organic system had so exalted and refined them that they made record nof thing neve before perceived he felt the ripple upo his face and nheard thei separate sound a they struck he looked at the

from twig nto twig he noted the prismatic color i all the dewdrop upo nmillio blade of grass the humming of the gnat that danced above the neddies of the stream the beating of the drago fly wing the nstrokes of the wate spider leg like oar which had lifted thei nboat all these made audible music fish slid along beneath his eye nand he heard the rush of it body parting the wate nhe had come to the surface facing dow the stream i moment the nvisible world seemed to wheel slowly round himself the pivotal point nand he saw the bridge the fort the soldier upo the bridge the ncaptai the sergeant the

movement were grotesque and horrible thei form ngigantic nsuddenly he heard sharp report and something struck the wate smartly nwithi few inch of his head spattering his face with spray he nheard second report and saw one of the sentinel with his rifle at nhis shoulde light cloud of blue smoke rising from the muzzle the nma i the wate saw the eye of the ma o the bridge gazing into his now through the sight of the rifle he observed that it wa gray eye nand remembered having read that gray eye were keenest and that all nfamous markme had them nevertheless this one had missed na counte swirl had caught farquha and turned him half round he wa nagai looking into the forest o the bank opposite the fort the sound nof clea high voice i monotonous singsong now rang out behind him nand came across the wate with distinctness that pierced and subdued nall othe sound eve the beating of the ripple i his ear although nno soldie he had frequented camp enough to know the dread

touched nhim o the face and hand the fell away continuing thei descent one nlodged betwee his colla and neck it wa uncomfortably warm and he nsnatched it out na he rose to the surface gasping fo

nfrom his enemy the sudde arrest of his motio the abrasio of one nof his hand o the gravel restored him and he wept with delight he ndug his finger into the sand threw it ove himself i handful and naudibly blessed it it looked like diamond ruby emerald he could nthink of nothing beautiful which it did not resemble the tree upo the nbank were giant garde plant he noted definite orde i thei

fired him random nfarewell he sprang to his foot rushed up the sloping bank and plunged ninto the forest nall that day he traveled laying his course by the rounding su the nforest seemed interminable nowhere did he discove break i it not neve woodma road he had not know that he lived i so wild nregio there wa something uncanny i the revelatio nby nightfall he wa fatigued footsore famishing the

ngentle acclivity studded with infrequent tree ove all the gathering ngloom of twilight thi ghostly mist rose along the wate it nfrightened and repelled him instead of recrossing i the directio nwhence he had come he turned his back upo it and went forward toward nthe dark inclosing wood suddenly he saw before him strange moving nobject which he took to be some large animal dog pig he could not nname it perhaps it wa bea he had see picture of bear but knew nof nothing to thei discredit and had vaguely wished to meet one but nsomething i form o movement of this object something i the

great expanse of blue sky rising from fringe of nthe top of tree i the foreground shutting out some of the tree nhigh du mound angula i outline and crossed by a intricate npatternless system of straight line the whole a immeasurable distance naway distance so inconceivably great that it fatigued him and he nclosed his eye the moment that he did so he wa conscious of a ninsufferable light sound wa i his ear like the low rhythmic nthunde of distant sea breaking i successive wave upo the beach nand out of this noise seeming part of it o possibly coming from nbeyond it and intermingled with it ceaseless undertone came the narticulate word jerome searing you are caught like rat i trap ni trap trap trap nsuddenly there fell great silence black darkness a infinite ntranquillity and

his term of unconsciousness including the nperiod of recovery during which he had had the strange fancy had nprobably not exceeded few second fo the dust of the wreck had not nwholly cleared away a he bega a intelligent survey of the situatio nwith his partly free right hand he now tried to get hold of the beam nthat lay across but not quite against his breast i no way could he ndo so he wa unable to depress the shoulde so a to push the elbow nbeyond that edge of the timbe which wa nearest his knee failing i nthat he could not raise the forearm and hand to grasp the beam the nbrace that made a angle with it downward and backward prevented him nfrom doing anything i that directio and betwee it and his body the nspace wa not half so wide a the length of his forearm obviously he ncould not get his hand unde the beam no ove it the hand could not ni fact touch it at all having demonstrated his inability he ndesisted and bega to think whethe he could reach any of the xc3 xa9bris npiled upo his leg ni surveying the mass with view to determining that point his nattentio wa arrested by what seemed to be ring of shining metal nimmediately i front of his eye it appeared to him at first to nsurround some perfectly black substance and it wa somewhat more tha nhalf inch i diamete it suddenly occurred to his mind that the nblackness wa simply shadow and that the ring wa i fact the muzzle of nhis rifle protruding from the pile of xc3 xa9bris he wa not long i nsatisfying himself that this wa so if it wa satisfactio by nclosing eithe eye he could look little way along the barrel to the npoint where it wa hidde by the rubbish that held it he could see the none side with the corresponding eye at apparently the same angle a nthe othe side with the othe eye looking with the right eye the nweapo seemed to be directed at point to the left of his head and n_vice versa _ he wa unable to see the uppe surface of the barrel but ncould see the unde surface of the stock at slight angle the piece nwas i fact aimed at the exact centre of his forehead ni the perceptio of this circumstance i the recollectio that just npreviously to the mischance of which this uncomfortable situatio wa nthe result he had cocked the rifle and set the trigge so that touch nwould discharge it private searing wa affected with feeling of nuneasiness but that wa a fa a possible from fea he wa brave nma somewhat familia with the aspect of rifle from that point of nview and of canno too and now he recalled with something like namusement a incident of his experience at the storming of missionary nridge where walking up to one of the enemy embrasure from which he nhad see heavy gu throw charge afte charge of grape among the nassailants he had thought fo moment that the piece had bee nwithdraw he could see nothing i the opening but braze circle what nthat wa he had understood just i time to step aside a it pitched nanothe peck of iro dow that swarming slope to face firearm is one nof the commonest incident i soldie life firearm too with nmalevolent eye blazing behind them that is what soldie is fo nstill private searing did not altogethe relish the situatio and nturned away his eye nafte groping aimless with his right hand fo time he made a nineffectual attempt to release his left the he tried to disengage his nhead the fixity of which wa the more annoying from his ignorance of nwhat held it next he tried to free his foot but while exerting the npowerful muscle of his leg fo that purpose it occurred to him that ndisturbance of the rubbish which held them might discharge the rifle nhow it could have endured what had already befalle it he could not nunderstand although memory assisted him with several instance i npoint one i particula he recalled i which i moment of mental nabstractio he had clubbed his rifle and beate out anothe gentlema nbrains observing afterward that the weapo which he had bee diligently nswinging by the muzzle wa loaded capped and at full cock knowledge nof which circumstance would doubtless have cheered his antagonist to nlonge endurance he had always smiled i recalling that blunde of his gree and salad day a soldie but now he did not smile he turned nhis eye agai to the muzzle of the rifle and fo moment fancied that nit had moved it seemed somewhat neare nagai he looked away the top of the distant tree beyond the bound of nthe plantatio interested him he had not before observed how light and nfeathery they were no how darkly blue the sky wa eve among thei nbranches where they somewhat paled it with thei gree above him it nappeared almost black it will be uncomfortably hot here he thought a the day advance wonde which way am looking njudging by such shadow a he could see he decided that his face wa ndue north he would at least not have the su i his eye and north nwell that wa toward his wife and childre bah he exclaimed aloud what have they to do with it nhe closed his eye a ca get out may a well go to sleep the nrebels are gone and some of ou fellow are sure to stray out here nforaging they ll find me nbut he did not sleep gradually he became sensible of pai i his nforehead dull ache hardly perceptible at first but growing more and nmore uncomfortable he opened his eye and it wa gone closed them and nit returned the devil he said irrelevantly and stared agai at the nsky he heard the singing of bird the strange metallic note of the nmeadow lark suggesting the clash of vibrant blade he fell into npleasant memory of his childhood played agai with his brothe and nsiste raced across the field shouting to alarm the sedentary lark nentered the sombre forest beyond and with timid step followed the faint npath to ghost rock standing at last with audible heart throb before nthe dead ma cave and seeking to penetrate it awful mystery fo the nfirst time he observed that the opening of the haunted cave wa nencircled by ring of metal the all else vanished and left him gazing ninto the barrel of his rifle a before but whereas before it had seemed nneare it now seemed a inconceivable distance away and all the more nsiniste fo that he cried out and startled by something i his ow nvoice the note of fea lied to himself i denial if do sing out ni may stay here till die nhe now made no furthe attempt to evade the menacing stare of the gu nbarrel if he turned away his eye a instant it wa to look fo

npoignant pai i his forehead the prophecy and menace of the bullet nforced him to reope them nthe tensio of nerve and brai wa too severe nature came to his relief nwith interval of unconsciousness reviving from one of these he became nsensible of sharp smarting pai i his right hand and whe he worked nhis finger togethe o rubbed his palm with them he could feel that nthey were wet and slippery he could not see the hand but he knew the nsensatio it wa running blood i his delirium he had beate it nagainst the jagged fragment of the wreck had clutched it full of nsplinters he resolved that he would meet his fate more manly he wa nplai commo soldie had no religio and not much philosophy he could nnot die like hero with great and wise last word eve if there had nbee some one to hea them but

touch the trigge of his rifle nhe cursed them and ordered them to go away it is no business of nyours he cried nthe creature went away they would retu late attack his face gnaw naway his nose cut his throat he knew that but he hoped by that time nto be dead nnothing could now unfix his gaze from the little ring of metal with it nblack interio the pai i his forehead wa fierce and incessant he nfelt it gradually penetrating the brai more and more deeply until at nlast it progress wa arrested by the wood at the back of his head it ngrew momentarily more insufferable he bega wantonly beating his nlacerated hand against the splinter agai to counteract that horrible nache it seemed to throb with slow regula recurrence each pulsatio nsharpe tha the preceding and sometimes he cried out thinking he felt nthe fatal bullet no thought of home of wife and childre of country nof glory the whole record of memory wa effaced the world had passed naway not vestige remained here i this confusio of

draw it few inch at time finally it wa naltogethe loosened from the wreckage covering his leg he could lift nit clea of the ground it whole length great hope came into his nmind perhaps he could work it upward that is to say backward fa nenough to lift the end and push aside the rifle o if that were too ntightly wedged so place the strip of board a to deflect the bullet nwith this object he passed it backward inch by inch hardly daring to nbreathe lest that act somehow defeat his intent and more tha eve nunable to remove his eye from the rifle which might perhaps now haste nto improve it waning opportunity something at least had bee gained ni the occupatio of his mind i this attempt at self defense he wa nless sensible of the pai i his head and had ceased to wince but he nwas still dreadfully frightened and his teeth rattled like castanets nthe strip of board ceased to move to the suasio of his hand he tugged nat it with all his strength changed the directio of it length all he

nthere wa a inquest and the customary verdict the deceased it nappeared came to he death through heart disease it wa before the ninventio of heart _failure_ though the heart of poo pauline had nindubitably failed the body wa embalmed and take to sa francisco by nsome one summoned thence fo the purpose neithe eva no benning naccompanying it some of the hotel gossip ventured to think that very nstrange and few hardy spirit went so fa a to think it very strange nindeed but the good landlady generously threw herself into the breach nsaying it wa owing to the precarious nature of the girl
